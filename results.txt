data x, data y: ['So, how you doing?I\'m doing okay.Good. So what\'s new?Um, not, not too much. Uh, I\'m just having, I think I\'m having, um, a little bit of trouble with feeling depressed.Okay. And when did you notice that you were feeling more depressed, [PATIENT NAME]?Um, I think it was, it was last Wednesday or Thursday.Okay, so Wednesday or Thursday. So 6, maybe 6 days, something like that. Okay, did anything happen back then that triggered the depression or it just kind of come on out of the blue?It just kind of came on.Okay. Um, so you\'re just feeling more sad or irritable?Um, more sad and lethargic. Uh, like I just wanted to lay, I just lay on the couch andOkay.Don\'t want to do anything.How\'s your sleep been with Lunesta?Um, I don\'t think it works for me too well.So you\'re not sleeping well. Are you having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?I\'ll sleep for about an hour, or hour and a half, and then I wake up.And then are you able to get back to sleep right away, or does it take a while?Well, I was taking the Lunesta at night and then I started trying to see if I could fall asleep first and I would and then I\'d wake up, and then I\'d, you know, take one then.You mean to get back to sleep?Yeah.And then would you sleep through the rest of the nightUmOr not?No, sometimes I\'d, I\'d stay awake for a long time orOkay.Uh, or wake up.Okay, has the weight gain leveled off since you got off the Doxepin?Yeah.So your weight stabilized?Yeah, I feel like it has.Okay. How\'s your appetite been lately?My appetite. Um, I think it\'s okay.Okay. Um, how\'s your focus or concentration?Uh, gosh, I can\'t, I haven\'t done anything.Are you able like to play music and stay focused for a while?I haven\'t played any music.You haven\'t wanted to or?Yeah, I haven\'t wanted to.Okay. Are you watching TV or?No, I usually just lay thereOkay, or reading.With my eyes closed.So, you\'re really not doing much during the day. Uh, you just kind of stay in bed all day long?Staying on the couch.On the couch. Okay.I just lay there with my eyes closed.Okay, are you worrying about things a lot, or not really?No.Okay.I don\'t feel like I am.Okay. Have you had any suicidal thoughts recently?No, no.Okay. So it sounds like you\'re just kind of fatigued, depressed, no motivation, not much joy in things, not much interest.Yeah.Okay. Well, we may need to, and about sleeping well, that\'s important too. We may make some changes in the medication. Any new stresses in your life that you can, uh, pinpoint?Um, I have a new sponsor because, because sometimes I just don\'t want to talk anyone when I get like this, and I get stressed out about having to call, and not returning calls to my friends.You haven\'t been returning calls. And your new sponsor, you\'re talking to your new sponsor?Yeah, I call, but it\'s really hard to get myself to do it. I don\'t want to do it.Okay. Have you told your sponsor you\'re feeling depressed?Uh, I told him a little bit I guess.Okay. I\'m just curious, did he have any suggestions or advice for you about that or not really?Not really.Okay.Um, just he\'s giving me things to do in the book and stuff like that.Okay. So [PATIENT NAME] I\'m just looking, you\'re taking the 2 Paxil still every day, right, 80 mg. The Wellbutrin, you\'re still taking 1 which is 300. Okay, you\'re still taking the Abilify.Yes.Okay, and the Lithium.Yes.Okay, and then the Lunesta which doesn\'t seem to be working. Um, we\'re at the maximum of Paxil. We\'re not at the maximum of Wellbutrin. We can go higher. We can go up to 450 mg and that\'s the one, of all the antidepressants, that\'s probably the most likely to give you some energy and get you going. Do you want to try increasing the dose of that one?Okay.I think it\'d be a good idea. Let me get you a prescription. Now they don\'t make a 450 mg strength tablet, so that means you have to take 3 of the 150\'s to get to that dose.Three of the 150\'s?Yes.Okay.You\'ve been taking the 300. Um, so do you have quite a few of those left, do you know?I think I do. I\'m not sure.If you do. I\'ll write a prescription for 3 of the 150\'s a day, but if you have a bunch of the 300\'s, you can take a 300 with 1 of the 150\'s to get to 450 mg.Oh, okay.Does that make sense?Yes.Or so you don\'t have to waste the 300\'s. Um, or when those run out, you can just take 3 of the 150\'s, okay?Okay.So, and you\'re taking the brand name I believe, right?Um, yes I am.Yeah, and I think we want to stick with that because I\'m hearing more reports of problems with the generics.Oh, okay.So let\'s try this, uh, first stuff, and hopefully this will help pull you out of it. If it doesn\'t in the next few weeks, then we can do some other things to get you feeling better, okay?Okay.If you feel like you start sinking any lower, will you call me because I don\'t want things to get any worse.Okay.Okay. I don\'t think they will with the medication. I think it\'ll actually be better, but I just want to sure we\'re moving in the right direction.Okay.Any questions about that at all?Uh, no.Okay. Now the other thing we need to talk about is sleep I guess because if the Lunesta\'s not working, that\'s going to contribute to your depression, and if we can find something to help you sleep better, that\'ll help get out of the depression. Um, I\'m just looking back to see what we tried before. The Trazodone caused kind of a morning hangover.Yeah. It was, I don\'t know, it was a weird one. When it was a low dose it didn\'t work, and then when it got too high, it was [INAUDIBLE] in the morning.Okay. You know, another thing we might consider, have you taken, yeah, you did take Seroquel. Do you remember how it affected you? It\'s been a year or so ago.The only thing I did with Seroquel was I think I ate more.Okay, because I was going to say at low doses, it has several uses. The lower dose is used for insomnia. It also helps with bipolar depression, and it also has mood stabilizing properties. Something we could try at a lower dose for sleep. You were on a pretty good dose of it before, 4 to 500 mg. Let me look back and see if you had problems with it.I like the Doxepin, but it, it\'s just the, the, the weight gain and the, and the, what is it, the, I can\'t remember, like theWell, the weight gain was the bigYeah, I know.Okay. Seroquel we stopped [DATE]. Oh, you had pneumonia at that time. See if there anything else? It was increasing your appetite, so we probably don\'t want to go back to that again. Um, we want to stay away from the addicted medications. Uh, let me keep thinking about that one as we\'re talking, okay, and we\'ll see if we can come up with something else that\'ll work better for you. The problem with Wellbutrin is it sometimes can worsen insomnia because it is kind of an energizing antidepressant. Sometimes that carries over into the evening hours. Sometimes it\'s hard for people to get to sleep. I don\'t know if that\'s contributing or not, but we want to find something that\'ll help you sleep well at night. Okay, well what else has been going on?Um, let\'s see, before that, you know, I was going to my meetings and, um, and doing those, those things.So you are going pretty regularly or have you cut back sinceI\'ve cut back since I started feeling, uh, bad.When was the last time you went to a meeting?Uh, Saturday before the football game.Uh, which football game?The, the, umOh, Air Force?Air Force.You go to the, do you have season tickets or do youYeah.Oh, good.Yeah.Was it fun?It was, yeah, it was fun.Air Force won.Yeah, 38, I think 38 to 17 or something like that.They\'re doing really well this year.Yeah.Do you have any other games you\'re going to?We\'re going to one this SaturdayOkay.Too.Do you know who they\'re playing?I\'m not sure.I think theyOh, TCU.Yeah. I think, no, I think they\'reNo, no.Was it Utah or BYU?BYU.That\'ll be good one.It\'s hard.Yeah. So they got a couple of tough games coming up, but if they do well, it could really propel them into the, some of the bowls, so.Yeah.Do you like going to the games?Yeah, I like going to the games.Good.I notice that my personality has changed a lot since last year when we used to go.In what way?I don\'t know. [NAME OTHER] says. Because I used to really, uh, excited and jump up and, you know, things like that and she says I act differently now.More subdued?Yeah.Huh, okay. Is that just since you\'ve been depressed, or even before?Before. I think it\'s just that I, I just don\'t have that, that energy feeling, you know.Okay.I have no, you know, but it\'s not all the time. I mean it does come and go.Yeah. I\'m just trying to figure out what can we do to keep you out of the depression. That\'s what I\'d really like to find a way to do. And sometimes if we understand what triggers it, that helps us. Sometimes it just comes out of the blue. Okay, is there anything you\'re looking forward to besides going to the Air Force games?Uh, no.Okay. Um, how are your lessons going? Are you still teaching?"Yeah, when I, when the lessons start, I always do better. I don\'t know why."Okay. Well for many people that\'s true when they\'re depressed. If they can find something to do, if they\'re active, it helps at least temporarily.I don\'t want to do it, but once the kids get there, it\'s usually, um, I get more motivated.Good. Okay, and how many lessons or hours of lessons do you teach in a week now?Uh, let\'s see, about 16.Sixteen lessons or hours?Sixteen lessons.Lessons. Is that about where you want to be?"Yeah. Right now I am because I take Tuesdays off because of, um, uh, I have my continuing care tonight and, uh "Okay.I like, uh, having the day off to, I\'m kind of easing my way back into doing stuff more and more.Okay. Okay, good, and often how often do you go to continuing care?Um, once a week on Tuesdays.Okay.At 6:00.Are you still feeling positive about that?Um, you know, sometimes it\'s really good, and then sometimes it\'s kind of, it depends on how the counselor is.Okay. So it\'s a different person on different weeks?No, it\'s the same person.Oh.But sometimes she\'ll get off on talking about, I don\'t know.Tangents.Yeah, like football.UmInstead of talking about drug addiction and stuff like that.I see. Now, at continuing care, do they charge for that, or is that part ofYeah, it\'s, um, $500 if you finish their program.Okay, and is insurance covering that?Uh, yeah, they pay for that.Okay, good. Okay, good, and the continuing care goes on for how long [PATIENT NAME]?It goes on for, continuing care, for a year.One year, okay. So you\'re planning to stick it out for the year then?Yeah.Okay, good.Yeah, I want to do, I\'m not going to do anything for the first year.Good.Except just, you know, recovery stuff.I think that\'s wise. You\'re going to continuing care. You\'re going to meetings. Um, you do a lot of things to take care of yourself. That\'s good.I didn\'t have a good day last Friday because I went to go see my friend [NAME OTHER] in [DEIDENTIFIED].Uh-huh.And we went over to [DEIDENTIFIED], and, uh, I always have a, I don\'t know why because she was a crack addictUm-hum.But we just relate together so well. I mean we\'re so similar in a lot of waysUm-hum.And, uh, she\'s married too, and [NAME OTHER]\'s okay. She knows it\'s a friend.Yeah.And we went to go see a friend that went back into [DEIDENTIFIED] for alcohol, and, uh, it was neat seeing the counselors and stuff I hadn\'t seen in a while.Uh-huh.And, um, it\'s, it\'s kind of, uh, all right, he [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHING]. Uh, she\'s, uh, but it\'s a lot of fun. You know, she\'s, she\'s an alcoholic and, um, and then [NAME OTHER] was a crack addict and then I was doing prescription drugs and we would have never hung out together probably, but now we all have this common bond where it\'s all the same thing.Yes. Yeah, it\'s good to find people that we share experiences with like who will understand and support us.Yeah.How much sobriety do you have now?Um, let\'s see on the [DATE], I\'ll have 5 months.Five months on, uh, [DATE]? Good. Yeah because I\'m guessing too probably you and [NAME OTHER] are probably 2 of the few that are still sober. Is that true? Do you know?Yeah, me and [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER]. Um, yeah there\'s a few people that made it.Out of how many were in the program when you were there?Fifty.Yeah because the relapse rate is so high and so many people quit on their, working their programs, they relapse. So that\'s good that you haven\'t quit because it destroys people and they relapse and keep going back and using again. So, okay.Well, I never, I mean I haven\'t gone to a meeting since the way that I felt, but I never, I mean I still get thoughts. I mean I can\'t say I don\'t, but I, um, I can\'t give up because, you know, to give up for me would be to die.Right. Yes. And it would affect not just you, but [NAME OTHER]. You got to stayYeah.To affect other people too. I think that\'s one of the things that addicts start using drugs or alcohol is would become more self centered or some folks, we forget about how our behavior is affecting others, and so they get sober, they start, you know, feeling more connected with others and realizing that how we live our lives affect others negatively or positively and we can be a positive influence to people\'s lives, and there are lot of amazing people who are recovering addicts or alcoholics that have done incredible things for people because of the way they\'ve lived their lives.UmSo, just reading some different accounts of [NAME OTHER]\'s story about, you know, how he got sober, and thinking about how many lives he touched because he chose to get sober and stay sober, you know. I mean its millions of people.Yeah.So, it may not have seemed like a big thing to him at the time. I don\'t know, but, uh, over, you know, over the years, it made a huge difference to a lot of people. I think sometimes we don\'t always know how our choices now could have a profound positive influence on us later. All your students that you\'re teaching, I mean if you dead from using, all your students would not benefit from what they\'re learning from you then.Yeah, and that would really hurt them.Exactly. SoBecause they have fun when they come over.Exactly.The little kids and stuff like that.Yep, and that, that wouldn\'t be available to them. So, by you staying sober, you\'re not just helping yourself, you\'re doing positive for a lot of other people too.Yeah, that\'s the thing they talk about all the time is, is how you can be helpful to other people.Yes.And, uh, just about yourself.Exactly.About myself.Um-hum. Good. So [PATIENT NAME] I think, I\'m glad you\'re getting out and doing things like going and seeing [NAME OTHER] and going to football games. I think that\'s real important even when you\'re depressed. If you can, force yourself to get out and do things because it really help. And the other thing, things that help are exercise. It\'s really hard to exercise when feeling depressed. Are you doing anything for exercise now?No.Okay. Is there any kind of exercise that you like or enjoy?No.Okay, not really, huh.[LAUGHING]. I\'m really bad.Do you even like walking or swimming or?I like walking.Okay. I mean walking is one of the best forms of exercise. Um, I don\'t know how the weather\'s going to be today, but, you know, sometimes if people just get out and walk or even, you know, around the block or, you know, around their neighborhood just a little bit each day, their depression starts lifting because we\'re releasing endorphins and other chemicals in the brain that help lift us out of depression.UmUh, do you have a dog?Yeah.Yeah. Do you walk your dog?Um, I, I used to, but she\'s got a hurt leg right now.Oh, okay. So it\'s hard to take her out.Yeah.Uh, do you and [NAME OTHER] ever enjoy going on walks together?Yeah, and we also have a treadmill too.Okay.That I can listen to music on when I walk.Okay. Yeah, and also people like to do treadmills with music or TV in the room or something just to distract them, but yeah, if you could do anything like that, that would help.Okay.Um, what else helps? Um, getting up out of bed or up out of the sofa, just getting up and moving even is good or getting outside because when you\'re at home on the sofa, are the curtains or drapes pulled?Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I like it dark.Yeah, a lot of people do when they\'re depressed. The problem is then your body and brain aren\'t getting the things, you need the sunlight because sunlight also helps with depression for many people especially in the winter months. So if you can even get outside 15, 20 minutes a day or open the curtains for a little bit, it may start to lift the depression by producing those chemicals your body needs again. Um, so those are some things you can do just to try to get to feeling better. I don\'t think you\'re drinking any alcohol either, are you?Alcohol?Yeah.Oh no.I didn\'t think so. I\'m just thinking about things that could, you know, interfere with the depression. UmIf I drank, that would be a slip for me if I had that.Okay.It would get me right back to where I was.Yeah. Yep. Uh, what else? Are things going okay between you and [NAME OTHER] right now?Yeah, everything\'s going really well.Good. Okay.It\'s just kind of weird because you get this, it\'s like this hopeless feeling, you know.Yes.And it feels dark and, um, you know, you don\'t want to feel it.Um-hum.You know, and that\'s what itThat\'s the depression, yep. Yeah, it kind of sucks the life out of us when we\'re depressed.Yeah.Um, so [PATIENT NAME] I\'m thinking again of things to do, or if you can, get some kind of exercise, sunlight exposure, social contacts, be around people, go to games, you know, teach lessons, go see [NAME OTHER] and do things like that that can help. We\'ll bump up the Wellbutrin, see if that\'ll help. Uh, and getting a good night\'s sleep is really important. Do you ever take antihistamines over the counter like Benadryl?Um, I have, uh, when I take, uh, Clarinex.Okay, and that\'s not sedating usually. Have you ever taken Benadryl?Yeah.Does it make you tired or sleepy?UmDo you remember?No, it might make me a little drowsy, but notOkay, because some people take it at higher doses for sleep. Um, you know, at lower doses, it works great as an antihistamine. At higher doses, it\'s more sedating and a lot of people find if they take 50, which is 2 tablets, or 75, which is 3 tablets, um, that it really helps them get to sleep and stay asleep. Have you ever tried that?Um, I never tried it at a high dose.Do you want to try that for sleep? It\'s very safe. It doesn\'t usually cause a hangover. That would be one option if you want to try it.Um, what would be the other option?Well, I\'m still thinking about an option.Oh, sorry.Uh, no it\'s okay. I\'m thinking of what else, well, there\'s some other medicines like Rozerem, have you heard of that, but it takes a long time to work off, and so I don\'t think it\'s a good choice for you. Well, there\'s Sonata. Have you heard of it?PT:Sonata. Sonata\'s a short acting one. I don\'t know if you ever tried it. The problem, the good thing about Sonata is it doesn\'t cause the morning grogginess. The bad thing is it usually wears off after about 4 hours.Oh.So I don\'t know if it would get you through that initial waking up phase, and then keep, and then if you\'d stay asleep naturally on your own, you know, after that because the medicine will be out of your system. See the good thing about Sonata though is if you wake up during the night and you have at least 4 more hours to sleep, you can take another dose of it during the night to get you back to sleep. Um, I\'ve been told the astronauts take it out in the space shuttle because they\'re going on the earth every one point something hours. They have a sunrise and a sunset every hour, so it really messes up their sleep. So they something to help them sleep, but they also need something that isn\'t going to make them impaired mentally if they have to wake up, if there\'s an emergency, and they don\'t want them to sleep too long, so they use Sonata because they can get a good, a good restful sleep and then wake up and be alert. So that\'s another prescription sleep medicine that\'s not addictive that we could use. My only hesitation with about it, my only hesitation about it is that it tends to wear off after 4 hours, so I don\'t know if you\'d stay asleep naturally for the rest of the night or if you\'d wake up after 4 hours.Oh.But again, if you did wake up, you can take another one. So that would be another option. UmAnd that, you know that, that doxepin really works so well.Yes.You know. Is it sometimes worth just to, um, saying okay, I\'m going to gain some weight?Well it depends. I mean how much are you weighing now, do you know?I think I\'ve come down a little bit. I think I weigh 170.Well it\'s, it\'s an option if you want to. We can always go back to it and just monitor your weight because I don\'t want you to keep going up too high because that can cause other health problems, but yes, that\'s always an option. So if you want to go back to it. Do you still have some doxepin at home? Is that what you want to do, or do you want to try something else?You know it\'s kind of a real mix for me because there\'s such a, it really keeps me asleep the whole night.Yeah."And it even seems like it helps with depression."It is an antidepressant also, yes.And it seems like it works with the Paxil really well.You know, and that\'s a good point. It may be that part of the reason you feel more depressed is because you\'ve gotten off the Doxepin. Um, you know, we could go back on the Doxepin for, for your sleep and for depression and just monitor your weight closely to make sure it doesn\'t go up too high. Do you want to do that?Yeah, that\'s probably, I think that\'s, I mean I have to just buckle down and stay with that, I guess.Okay.And it\'s inexpensive too.Right, that\'s, that\'s a big advantage. Okay, let me, let me write this down.That the, maybe when that started wearing off or something.It could be when the doxepin kind of got out of your system. Yeah, but not only did it not help you sleep because it wasn\'t in your system, but the depression could have gotten worse. Now, let me see what dose you were taking. I had down 50 mg and you were taking up to 3 at bedtime. Do you want to stay with that same dosage range? Does that seem like it worked okay?Um, it seemed to work real well at that dose.Okay. Well let\'s do both then. Let\'s, now do you still want to go up on the Wellbutrin also just to see if it\'ll help pull you out of the depression?Yeah.Okay, why don\'t we go ahead and try that then. Okay, I\'ll give you the prescription. Yeah, so hopefully between the Wellbutrin increase and getting back on the Doxepin, hopefully that\'ll help. Also Wellbutrin, for some people, can decrease appetite a little bit. So maybe the higher dose of Wellbutrin may reduce the weight gain possibly. I can\'t promise that, but it might help.Okay.So we\'ll see how that works and adjust as we need to as well. That sounds like a plan.Um-hum.So what else is going on?Uh, not much else is really going on. You know, I was working on, on this stuff in here, but I haven\'t worked on it in a, in a while.Okay, some of the self critical thoughts or is this, what do you have written?No, it\'s the stuff I was doing in that book. Uh, um, I think we, last time we talked about naming and refocusing.Yes.Um, does the Paxil also help with obsessive?It tends to, yes, or it can. Do you feel like it\'s helping?I don\'t know.You can\'t tell.You know, I, I didn\'t know, I remember one time you gave me a medication called, uh, fluvoxamine.Yes.Is that a better one than Paxil or they\'re the same?They\'re similar, but different. So some people do better with one or the other. So there\'s one not that\'s consistently better than the other, it just depends on the individual.Oh.Did you feel like maybe the fluvoxamine helped you more with theWith the obsessive.Okay. Do you, well, I was going to say do you feel like you want to go back to it. Like the Luvox is also better, or fluvoxamine, is also typically better for sleep. Um, I\'m just thinking we\'re making so many changes, I\'m a little hesitant to make a third change too.Oh, I understand.But at some point, do you feel like that\'s something you\'d maybe like to consider going back to?Yeah, I think it, I think it helps me with the, um, you know, I think it helped me with that a lot.Okay.Um, but I just wanted to ask because I, I still have, I know [NAME OTHER] has a big bottle of it at home, and, um, that we had from when I took it before.Okay.AndWell [PATIENT NAME] what we might do then is give it these 2 weeks to get you back on the doxepin and try the higher dose of Wellbutrin and see how you\'re doing, and then once you\'ve been stabilized a couple of weeks, if you\'re still feeling like you want to try the fluvoxamine, we could do that next time maybe. So next week, next time is Thanksgiving I think. Maybe the next time we meet at least. No, not next week.Is next week Thanksgiving?I have to look and see. I\'m not sure I\'m going to schedule, but, uh, it\'s something we could certainly look at and consider switching you back if you want to try that. Okay.I just remembered you were saying that they both work with the, uh, is it serotonin?Yes, Uh-huh. Yeah, and the medicines that increase serotonin tend to be the best at helping with obsessive thoughts.You know, part of it I think with the eating, I was talking with my sponsor, is it\'s like my addiction is, is still active even though I\'m not drinking or using drugs, but I\'m looking for things that will make me feel good.Um-hum.You know, externally and, and so food will do that, or, you know, maybe even sleep would, would take away that, that feeling. You know, the, trying to sleep or, um, anything else that\'ll bring like immediate gratification.Uh-huh.Um, and I, I think that could be part of it too.Okay. So maybe just looking for some sort of way to feel better.Yeah.Which is why people use drugs a lot of time, but it is also why people use food sometimes or sleep or other things too.Yeah.You know, the key is to find healthy ways to feel good that don\'t have side effects, and side effects like drugs do or like the overeating does or oversleeping.Yeah. I guess as I keep working the steps, that\'s going to get better.It should, yes.Because we\'re going to do the third step I think this week.Okay. Remind me, do you remember what the third step is?UmIf you don\'t, I\'ve got my book here, butAny decision to turn our world or our lives over to the care of God is [INAUDIBLE].Okay. Okay. So, and are you doing that when you see your sponsor at meetings? Are you getting together outside of meetings?Yeah, we get out together outside of the meetings.Okay, good.And, and talked about, you know, uh, the steps andOkay.And the book and stuff like that.Good. So do you feel pretty comfortable with him as a sponsor?Uh, you know, it\'s kind of weird because I feel like he\'s an authority figure.Okay.He\'s not, he\'s a really nice guy.Uh-huh.But I tend to get that feeling anyways.Is he older than you?No, he\'s probably younger than me.Okay. So do you know what it is about him that you see him as an authority figure?He\'s real confident and, um, you know, confident kind of person.Okay.Um, and he\'s more of a laid back I think person.Okay, but how much sobriety does he have, do you know?Gosh, he\'s got, uh, I don\'t know if it\'s, I think \'93.I\'m sorry.Um, \'93.He\'s like 15 years. So that\'s a lot of sobriety. So that\'s, and his was with prescription drugs?Uh, he did alcohol, uh, crack cocaine and other things like that.Okay.And whatever he could get.Okay, so he\'s got a pretty good history of sobriety, which is good. So just as authority, so it\'s more just his demeanor and his personality you feel like, rather than his age?Yeah.Okay. And so it that, um, seeing him as an authority figure, does that feel like a negative or a positive experience for you or neutral?You know, it makes me nervous to call especially if I haven\'t done something I should have done like go to a meeting or, but that\'s probably part of why he wants me to call.Yeah.So I keep in contact and I\'m doing the things I should be doing.Okay, and does it feel like you\'re nervous to call because you feel like he\'s going to be upset with you?Yeah.And does he get upset with you?No.Okay. So that\'s what they call projection where we expect something out of someone, whether it\'s true of them or not, and it\'s usually based on our past experience. So through your past experience with authority figures is they\'re going to get upset with you if you don\'t do something you\'re supposed to do, they you\'ll project that onto him and expect the same out of him even though you may not be that way.Yeah.So [PATIENT NAME] the good thing is the more experience you have with him, positive experiences, maybe the more that\'ll shift for you where you won\'t come to expect that out of authority figures anymore. Um, yeah, I\'ve even felt that between you and I at times that you felt like I was going to get angry at you for something that was kind of a normal human thing to do. Do you remember that at times?Oh yeah, yeah.So, I\'m hoping that maybe in different relationships that you have, do you see me as an authority figure?Yeah.Okay. So maybe in, in a relationship that you have with people that you see as authority figures, hopefully they\'ll be more positive experiences where if you don\'t do something that you think you\'re supposed to do, people don\'t get upset with you or punish you or blame you or anything, just understanding and supportive that maybe that\'ll start to shift where you won\'t be so worried about, you know, reaching out and using people for support when you need it. Does that make sense?Yeah.Okay.Um, then it\'s hard, hard being honest and, and those kind of things.Yeah, because in your experiences, if you were honest with your parents, what would happen?Yeah, I\'d be bad.Yeah, you getting punished or get hurt. Okay, yeah, so you\'re doing a good job of working to change those patterns in your brain, those expectations.Yeah. I think, um, you know, uh, one of the things that bothers me, and I am sorry for what I, what I did, but you know, with the prescriptions that I got from you, misusing them. You know, that was the wrong thing to do. You know, I\'m sorry about that.Well, [PATIENT NAME] your apology is accepted, but you don\'t, you know, it\'s, you don\'t even owe me an apology I don\'t think. I mean, but it\'s, it\'s something that happens to people. It happens to a lot of good people, that people start using medications and then they feel better, so they want to use more and more, and sometimes our brains just kick in to this gear where we don\'t think about the consequences to ourselves or to others and we just keep going. And you didn\'t hurt me or harm me in any way, so, um, I just feel badly for you that, you know, it could have killed you. I\'m glad it didn\'t, and I\'m glad that you\'re working so hard on your sobriety because it\'s a way, you can turn a really negative experience into a really positive experience, not just for you, but for other people too.Um, you know, it was kind of weird how it started because I was taking the medication as I was supposed to.Yeah.And something got in my head and, and was like I can get [NAME OTHER]\'s, you know, syringes and I could do that.Um-hum.And, uh, you know, it was just insanity to me.Well, it is. Our brain sometimes tells things that aren\'t good things. You know, they can play tricks, our brains can play tricks on us. They do all the time, and if they trip, trip us up, we can start doing things that are not healthy or even dangerous, or even deadly. And, uh, the problem is that once we start going down those paths, sometimes our brain just keeps reinforcing the same kinds of thoughts. And that\'s why people get addicted to things. They keep telling themselves things that aren\'t true and they keep living their lives that way. It\'s sad and scary.Yeah.It\'s gotten some really good people, and there are a lot of wonderful addicts. You know, great wonderful people and boy, when they\'re into their addictions, they\'re not people you want to be around because they lie. They steal. They cheat. They, you know, and it\'s not, that\'s not their normal personality. It\'s the addictive personality that takes over.I\'m learning to change a lot of the things. I\'m, I\'m being more honest. I still catch myselfYeah.You know, doing stuff or doing something I shouldn\'t do, but they\'re getting farther and farther between. The thing is I keep working steps and everything.Um-hum, okay.And, um, I guess it\'s a process.Um-hum.It isn\'t like one day I, I always expect, okay, I\'m clean now, everything\'s going to be perfect, and it\'s not like that.No, it is definitely a process. It\'s a matter of working at it and just making good choices, being honest and, with ourselves and others, and as we do that, life gets easier and easier because when we\'re lying or hiding an addiction, you know, it just makes life more and more difficult till eventually something gives, either it\'s our health or our relationships or something gives because it\'s just not sustainable. People can\'t stay addicts forever. Either they die or they get, you know, put in jail or they lose their relationships. Something goes wrong or your health fails.Yeah.So, it\'s just not a sustainable lifestyle.Yeah, I\'m fortunate to, you know, I made my way through it and, uh, so I\'m kind of the other things. I, I still have my wife and everything.Right. Well thank goodness you got help early enough because if it kept going, you probably wouldn\'t, you know. You probably would have lost your wife and people lose their homes. They lose everything. It just, um, destroys people\'s lives. So, but again, to your credit, you\'re turning it around turning it into something positive.I guess I hid it from her. She had no idea what I was doing.Um-hum.I was hiding it from herWell, you knowFor so long.And [PATIENT NAME] another thing is that addictions destroys trust like with spouses that don\'t know what\'s going on and they find out what was happening and they don\'t trust for a while, but you\'re rebuilding that trust again with [NAME OTHER] too where she\'s going to learn that, yeah, she can trust you because you are being honest with her. As long as you keep being honest with her, it\'ll just keep building the trust back again, and that\'s one of the real cornerstones of a healthy marriage or relationship is there\'s got to be trust because if that\'s not there, the marriage isn\'t healthy. SoYeah.So you\'re rebuilding it, so that\'s good. That\'s really good.Yeah, I know I\'m having a really, um, I\'m having a really hard time with intimacy with [NAME OTHER].Okay.It\'s like I\'m, I shut myself off, butWhat, emotional or sexual or both?Both.Okay. And do you know what that\'s about that you\'re shutting yourself off from her?Um, I don\'t know. It\'s like this, this fear that I have. Um, you know, I, um, I, I think, um, well one of the, one of the things is, um, you know, I\'ve never, I was always, I was always around my family and stuff like that, and, uh, I was, and there was always, um, a lot of things around, things around the house and stuff like that.Um-hum.Um, pornography and stuff like that.Um-hum.And, uh, you know, I don\'t know why, but since I got out, when I got out of rehab, I started looking at it on the internet.Um-hum.And I think I have like guilt and stuff over it.Okay. Is [NAME OTHER] how does she feel about you looking at pornography?She doesn\'t know.Does she agree with it or doesn\'t like it? Oh, she doesn\'t know. Do you have a guess about how she would react if she found out? Would she be okay with it or would she be upset?Upset.She would be, okay. Okay, uhAnd then that\'s something I feel I, that I need to stop because, you know.Because?Um, because one thing it makes me feel ashamed.Okay.Because I don\'t, I don\'t really like it and, you know, I want to have intimacy with my wife.Uhhuh, okay. [PATIENT NAME] if you were to look at, um, pictures on the internet that were sexually stimulating, but not pornography, would you feel guilty then?Probably not.Okay. Um, so, um, like if you watch a, a movie that\'s not pornography, but it\'s, you know, um, maybe an erotic movie or a romance or something that involves nudity, do you feel guilty about that?No.Okay. And if you and [NAME OTHER] watched something like that together, do you feel embarrassed or guilty about that?Um, I don\'t think I would.Okay. So if they show like a lovemaking scene that\'s well done and tasteful and all, that\'s okay?Yeah.Okay. So there\'s some line there that gets crossed then for you where you start to feel guilty about it, okay. And do you know what that line is? Do you know where is it okay and where is it not okay for you?Yeah.What\'s, what\'s the difference?Um, where it goes from being tasty and stuff to that to just being elicit.Okay. All right, um, because what I\'m thinking about is it\'s normal for people to enjoy looking at, um, stimulating movies, for example, or pictures. That\'s just human nature. I mean men like to see attractive women walking down the street, they turn and look and women do the same, and that\'s not abnormal, but there is some line that people cross sometimes where they feel guilty about that, or feel uncomfortable with it, and I think, you know, for example, in some cultures where people don\'t wear clothes, you know, like in Africa or the Amazon, people don\'t think it\'s bad or guilty to look at nude bodies because it\'s normal. So we create some division in our minds about what\'s okay and what isn\'t, and there are a couple of ways of handling that. One is either to stay on the side that\'s okay and look at those things that we feel okay about, and we don\'t feel guilty about, so we don\'t have to feel guilty. Um, or the second is to find some way to feel, to have a healthy relationship with, uh, with nudity or sexuality. Um, so I mean for you maybe is there, you know, I know a lot of kids used to look at National Geographic and feel guilty looking at nude, you know, people in Africa or something because they were looking at nude bodies and, and that was a, a bad thing. Well now people don\'t necessarily think of that as a bad thing.UmAnd nudity in and of itself, isn\'t. It\'s maybe how it\'s portrayed or how\'s it done. Like you said if it\'s tasteful or distasteful, that\'s either an upset.Yeah.So, um, what I hear you saying too though is looking at the pornography takes away from your relationship with [NAME OTHER] too, is that right?Yeah, I feelOkay. So is there a way that you could take that desire, that interest, and channel it back into your marriage with [NAME OTHER]? I mean could the two of you look at, um, romantic or sensual movies that aren\'t pornographic, for example?Yeah.Okay.Yeah, we could do that.Do, do you rent movies?Um, sometimes we do.Like at Blockbuster or something? Do you ever pick movies that are sensual or maybe a little erotic, but not pornographic?Um, not usually.Okay, and who picks the movies? Do you or does she, or do you kind of do it together?It usually comes down to [NAME OTHER].Okay, she usually picks them?Yeah.So if you were to suggest to her a movie that looked kind of sensual, but, or erotic, but not pornographic, do you think she\'d be open to watching it with you?Yeah, she probably would.Okay, because you might try that sometime. It might be a way just to increase the intimacy because sometimes seeing a movie like that kind of opens us up a little bit and helps us feel more relaxed about it. Um, does that make sense?Yeah, a lot.Okay. I don\'t know of any movies off the top of my head to even suggest, but you might just go to Blockbuster sometime and see. Let\'s find something a little different this weekend and just see if we find something that we like. I\'m trying to think what else could you do? So you could watch movies that are tasteful. Um, what else? Well, here\'s another one. A lot of the men looking at the, um, like looking at the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition. Do you feel guilty about looking at that?No.No and because it\'s tastefulYeah.Reasonably tastefully done. Okay, so, um, and for a lot of men, if they look at pictures like that, women in swimsuits, they get sexually aroused and they\'re interested then, and they can use that energy, or sexual energy to channel it back into their marriage.Um-hum.Does that ever work for me? I mean if you look at pictures like that, then do you feel like you want to be more intimate with [NAME OTHER] or not necessarily?Uh, you know, it, it\'s really been a struggle because my whole life has, was really dysfunction.I understand.And, and I think it\'s always been hard for me to even before, I don\'t know why this happened after, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], but even before that, it\'s always been hard for me to connect emotionally and, and physically.Um-hum.Uh, I just want to shut myself off like I have shame or I have, uh, you know, I wonder if I could, if I even did that so, to even make myself feel more ashamed.Okay. So you just feel ashamed about sex in general?Yeah.Okay. You know, but [PATIENT NAME], another option would be to even think about getting a couple of books like The Joy of Sex. Do you know about that book? There\'s some books that are tastefully done by therapists or doctors about sexuality that, you know, are not intended to be pornographic at all. They\'re intended to help people develop healthy sexual relationships, and it might even be worth, I don\'t think I have it here. It might even be worth getting a book like that and having it at home just so you can read about it, or they have some pictures that, again, are tastefully done and not pornographic, of sketches or drawings of things, um, just showing different sexual positions, for example, and talk about what is healthy sexuality. Do you think something like that would maybe help transition from feeling ashamed to feeling more positive?Yeah, maybe that would help.Okay.But something to change the, the way I\'ve been trained or whatever.Exactly. So a couple of suggestions you might try. One would be to pick out a movie that\'s sexual, but in a tasteful way, and there are a lot of movies like that, you know, that are not pornographic movies and they have a theme to the movie and they have a plot, but there may be some erotic scenes in it or something that are tastefully done. So just to kind of open up to that again, or maybe getting a book like The Joy of Sex, for example, that\'s tastefully done, that just talks about sexuality and what is healthy sexuality and it might help you kind of, like you said, overcome some of that shame or guilt that you feel, that you were conditioned to feel.Yeah, that\'s, that\'s what it really comes down to, that.Yeah.UmOkay. So do you want to maybe consider trying either a movie or a bookYeah.And just seeing how that works for you?Yeah.And then let me know if it, if it helps or not, and if it does, we can keep going, and if it doesn\'t, we can try something else.Okay.Okay. So yeah, let\'s work on intimacy, sexual and emotional intimacy too. Um, and I think a lot of emotional intimacy involves we need to feel safe, and we need to be able to be honest and open. So, yeah, if you\'re feeling guilty about looking at pornography, that\'s going to shut down intimacy because you\'re not going to feel open to talk about that. So if we can shift away from pornography into other healthy sexual expressions, it\'s going to be easier to be open with [NAME OTHER] just open verbally and emotionally, which will create more emotional intimacy too because you won\'t feel that guilt or shame. Does that sound okay?Yeah.Okay, good.That\'s, umOkay. Excellent. All right, well I guess we\'re out of time. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that we haven\'t yet?Oh, I, um, no I guess, you know, I was just, you know, I guess [INAUDIBLE] being sober it\'s, it\'s weird, but I don\'t know.What do you mean?At the beginning of it, you know.Oh.There\'s so many weird, you\'re not using anymore and it\'s like all these things and it\'s likeA lot of shifting in your life?Yeah.Yes. There\'s a lot of change, a lot of growth too. So I think you are growing [PATIENT NAME]. The fact that we\'ve been talking about some of these issues like sexuality and, and looking at the depression, I mean those are all good signs because if you were just using all the time, you\'d be numbed out to all these things. We wouldn\'t be working on them.Oh, okay.So it\'s a good sign. So let\'s see here, now, um, I guess Thanksgiving is actually 2 weeks away. I was going to say now many more sessions do we have left? Today is the 27th session. Um, so we have 3 more, 3 more this year before you run out of your insurance allotted sessions.Okay.Um, and 2 weeks I\'m going to be out of town. Do you want to meet next week, which is the [DATE]?Yeah, and then 2 weeks of December.And then, okay.And then we\'ll be leaving for Florida.Okay, that\'s right.On the [DATE].Okay, yes.Does that work out?There are actually 3, um, Tuesdays in December, the [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE]. So we could meet 2 of those 3 if you want.Okay.And then you\'ll be leaving the [DATE] and be gone, and then [PATIENT NAME] when you come back, then you\'re going to have different insurance, is that right?Yeah.Are you going to be changing doctors then?Yeah.Okay, so one of the things we should really look at maybe in December is, actually we want to look at it even next time, um, is who are some of those doctors on the list and seeing if maybe you can start making some phone calls now because a lot of the doctors have a long waiting list to get in if they\'re even taking new patients. Just so you know, I mean if you can\'t get in to see someone, I\'m not going to not be your doctor anymore. You know, I could still [INAUDIBLE] I\'d be happy to see you, but I know your insurance probably won\'t cover it. Who\'s your new insurance through?Aetna.Yeah, with Aetna, it depends on your plan. Sometimes they cover part of the visits, but not as much since I\'m not in the network, but anyway, I just want to reassure you that you\'re not going to be without a doctor in the interim, but it may take a while to get in to see someone too. So, I just want to make sure that maybe we get that, uh, process started before we get to January, okay.Okay.That\'ll be good. So I will see you next week then. If there\'s anything you need before then, oops, just give me a call, okay?I\'m taking the Wellbutrin andBack on the doxepin then. Yeah, okay.Okay.All right [PATIENT NAME].All right, thanks.You bet. Have a good week.Okay.Bye bye.Bye.', "So, you were just saying he's been angry, aggressive, threatening.He gets extremely aggressive, loud, violent, um, suicidal comments, killing comments, and then it's like a sudden decrease, but it always escalates to that level first, and, uh, he didn't, even in the mall in [DEIDENTIFIED], he grabbed his mom because she wouldn't buy him something or look at something for him, and he grabbed her and cut her mouth open, and he thinks his answer is he can leave home as soon as he gets, if he don't get his way, then he wants to leave home. If we don't let him leave home, then that's when he becomes very violent.How come, [PATIENT NAME]? What's happening?Nothing.Well, something's happening. This doesn't sound right at all, right? And this is pretty, for any count, it's pretty dramatic, kind of almost scary, right?It's not scary for you to beat your mom up? Yeah.Or to threaten to kill yourself?You're going to kill everybody in the house or yourself? What makes you say those things? The way you spoil [INAUDIBLE] and not me. That's why.So, do you take any responsibility for any of this?Nope.This is all someone else? Nothing to do?Umhum.Well, um, let's make a change in the meds. UmYeah, and it, it's mainly at home, but it's happened at work now, and at school he's had more issues in the last 9 week's than he's had, and contrary, we do notice it more if he misses a dosage of his medicine, but we're trying pretty hard to stay on top of that, and it's still, he's still having those outrages almost, definitely weekly, and it's more like every other night.Umhum.Did you get the results of his blood work? We did get that done.Okay. The blood work was okay. Um, his glucose was a little bit on the higher side, but otherwise it looked okay. Well, does the Strattera help because if he says some of this could be bipolar, not, you know, all of it the ADHD, and certainly it's not all of anything. I mean there is a lot of it that's common, butAnd I'm not sure if that's bipolar. I'm just thinking because it's just a sudden outrage and thenRight.After a period of time, he'll kind of come down and be normal, but sometimes we have to give inRight.In order to get there, but most of the time when he does lose control, he'll, he'll realize it a little bit later and then he wants to apologize, but it's too late then.Right. He's made all the threats. He said all the things.How have your hands been still? I want to see your other one. No. Let's see that one. Doctor, we looked at his hands lately, he's still, uh, show him that one. No.Umhum.He must still be doing that a lot. [INAUDIBLE].You know it would be not be a bad idea to talk to them outside about case management as well, um, where they can have someone come where they can meet [PATIENT NAME] outside of here, you know, whether it's at school or somewhere they could sit down and talk to him, do some counseling there rather than coming here like for sessions, and that often works very well. You know, it's like natural. It's like someone more like a peer, but someone who's a trained counselor, to sit down and talk, whether, again, as I said, it's at school or, you know, it's on the sidelines of baseball or just in the regular environment, um, but let's add something for the bipolar. I'm not saying it's bipolar.Is that symptoms though whatWellI'm describing or not?This can be pretty generic. It can be due to the ADHD as well. Um, we do see a lot of the agitation and impulsivity and saying things and then backtracking later as part of that, but either way, the seizure medicines like Depakote and Tegretol, which are for epilepsy, treat bipolar and treat impulse control problems as well. So they, whatever it's from, they do help settle, whether it's from bipolar or it's just impulse control problem. Um, because, you know, the ADHD part is being treated, and we are on the medication for that. Now, the Tourette's, the tics, that can cause that impulsivity as well, but again, we have treatment for that, you know, that's ongoing as well. So, it may be good to add something that'll help that impulsivity and see if it can take the edge off, but do do the case management. I think you'd really see. [PATIENT NAME] would see a difference as well.And I talked to him about pop too. I know you talked to him over and over, but he seems to think, and we try to limit it when we're with him, but see he's at that age where he likes to go do things.Um.But we can't let him go because when he comes back, he's a holy terror, and, and we're thinking when he goes place, he drinks pop after pop after pop, and when he drinks a lot of pop, it takes away from that medication working, doesn't it?It does. Not only that, but let us, remember what I told your dad, the glucose was high, and that pop will raise it even more.And that'sThat's a problem.And we told him he needs to find a Gatorade or another kind of drink he likes instead of pop, but he, he, and especially when he gets away from us, he'll drink pop after pop.And if it's caffeine pop, then it's quite a difference.But he is drinking diet, but I told him that still don't make any difference.No. Do you need the others as well? Now, the Depakote has to be monitored for the liver because it goes through the liver and sometimes it, it can hurt the liver. So we have to do a blood test on it to check the level as well in about a week, 10 days, but start 1 Depakote at night. Everything else stays the same for now. That should help settle some of that impulsivity down. It's not going to be a magic fix [PATIENT NAME]. You have to fix it. No one else can make you mad unless you let them. But talk to them outside about case management. I think that'll be good.Is, is there a generic for Depakote, or is that generic?Um, this one is not generic. UmBecause that's going to be, that's expensive. That's going to be hard for us to afford.Umhum.Generic won't be bad, but if it's not generic, I'd rather have something generic.There is none of those. This does come in a different generic. So I can change that. That's fine. Okay. And then the blood test in about, uh, a week or so [PATIENT NAME]. All right, [PATIENT NAME]. I hope you do better, [PATIENT NAME], okay?Yes. Do you have any Strattera on hand?", '(audio begins at 0:00:14.9) Thank you. Did you check your bank?I haven\'t gotten my statement yet.Oh.So I couldn\'t check that. But yeah it\'s been cashed.Oh.I didn\'t get the check back but (inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:00:33.1)That\'s good. Then they have a record of it.Okay. I was afraid because when we were here I wasn\'t a 100 percent sure because I went to physical therapy as well in (inaudible at 0:00:47.1) Israel.Uh-huh.And maybe that\'s what the check for (inaudible at 0:00:49.9) bounced. Was for the -It wasn\'t?No.Okay.Um-So you\'re here twice in one week?Why this week?This is the second time.Yeah. In two days.Mm-hmm.(inaudible at 0:01:12.5) I feel like I\'ve just been here.You have been.Yeah. Now it feels like fresh. (Pause from 0:01:25.6 to 0:01:40.5) I know last time I was here I said quite a lot. A lot of information. And it\'s true that a lot of things, a lot of different things actually, they all have to do with decisions and change.Mm-hmm. [0:02:00.4]Happening in my life. But in a one way, the way I react to it is, like it almost doesn\'t happen to (inaudible at 0:02:08.7) I think to me. It\'s not - "A," I don\'t know exactly what I want to happen.Mm-hmm.It\'s not like, it\'s not that I have a clear goal or a clear choice. What I want. And it\'s like, many, many times my, before facing something that\'s big, for many times I\'m a little numb. Like I\'m (inaudible at 0:02:52.8).You know, I mean it\'s so funny that you\'re saying this now. Because if I can interrupt for a second, the last session is also fresh for me. And I thought a lot about it. And I thought a lot, it\'s really two different things. And the first thing is that you\'re saying that you feel a little bit numb or that your decision feels a little bit disconnected from you.Mm-hmm. From me.And it strikes me as interesting that I actually, as much as you said last time, you know which was a tremendous amount about your past. About your present. I felt actually very disconnected from what you were saying to me. I was trying to find a way to speak and be present. And the second thing, it\'s not only that I felt disconnected but that I felt very tentative and cautious about saying anything to you.For?I\'m not sure why. I\'m still thinking that through. Because you just kind of opened with saying that you felt numb, it felt like an opportunity to share with you what I was feeling. Because it\'s very important to me to feel connected and not numb. [0:04:13.0]Mm-hmm.And that\'s actually just how I felt last session. So I wanted to know what you thought about that? And see if we can make some use of that.(long pause from 0:04:24.8 to 0:04:32.2) Um-(Another long pause from 0:04:32.7 to 0:04:40.2)Did I feel disconnected to you or did we feel distant? Or -Last time?Yeah.Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes, a little. And I guess it\'s - and it also brings me to the fact that you asked me before what it is I want from you.Mm-hmm.And I don\'t really have an answer for that.Mm-hmm. Even though, I get the feeling, I\'m not sure, I get the feeling that there is something, even if you\'re not sure what it is, I feel very much that you want something. And like I\'m not quite -Mm-hmm. Sure what it is.Well that I\'m not quite giving you what it is.Mmm.That you would want. And I\'ve been aware of that feeling for some time. And it strikes me as interesting in the context of you trying to make a decision in the context of relationships and similar feelings might be there. [0:06:17.0]Mm-hmm. (Long pause from 0:06:18.7 to 0:06:45.6) I think it\'s hard for me to be clear. I think for myself and for a lot of people around me.Mm-hmm.To send a clear message. Because almost any kind of message. If it\'s bad or good or when it\'s - I don\'t really know why.I was just going to ask you.I don\'t. I don\'t really know why. I\'m trying to figure, thinking about why. I can see it\'s almost, well in many aspects of my life.Mm-hmm. Let\'s stick to the moment for a second. Okay?Okay. [0:08:01.4]It seems what you\'re saying is that to communicate clearly with another person -Mm-hmm.- about things, about anything that\'s important, whether it\'s difficult or positive or whatever it is. Is very difficult for you. And you, my sense is, what I feel, is that I\'m not quite sure - Let\'s see, how can I say this? When somebody communicates clearly, you have a sense of who they are. And so here I am feeling a little bit distant. And I think it\'s not only because I don\'t know what it is, right? It\'s not only the content. But I\'m not quite sure who it is. If you know what I mean.Mm-hmm.Does that make sense?Yeah.And my sense is, that this is the way that I can help you in these sessions. More than figuring out the content of the decision. That if this is the way in which you might have difficulty making decisions. I can help you look at that process.Mm-hmm.And what it\'s like to interact with somebody in the process. That\'s my sense of things. But I\'m interested in hearing your feedback. And I\'m aware that for the first time I\'m talking a lot. And you\'re not talking so much. So.I don\'t really know what should I do next. Like I understand, I hear what you\'re expecting from me. I don\'t know. [0:10:07.3]Well what do you hear that I\'m expecting from you?I think to change. But I don\'t know exactly I\'m supposed to do. Or how I\'m supposed to speak. Or what -You\'re not sure what I\'m saying or what I\'m asking.No. I hear what you\'re saying. But I\'m not sure exactly what -What -Yeah.Okay. So let me back track.I understand what you\'re saying. I just don\'t understand what I\'m -How you should respond.(inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:10:43.0) Yeah. Or what I can do about it.So how about this? Instead of you worrying about how to respond, which now I could be wrong, but when you say that, that you\'re worried about how to respond, I think, my feeling is, that you\'re worried about how to respond. About what to do to give me what it is that I\'m asking for. Whereas really I\'m asking for something different. Which is simply for you to say what you feel. What you feel in the room. Did you feel disconnected the last time? Were you aware of that feeling?Mm-hmm.Is that something you talked about that as something you felt with James. So I\'m just saying let\'s look at the moment. And -Okay.And if you, even now, this is a different kind of interaction for us. We haven\'t had this very often. What is it like?(long pause from 0:11:33.0 to 0:11:55.0) It\'s true that I am - well last time I felt disconnected. [0:12:03.7]Mm-hmm.And sometimes I know that what I do when I feel that I\'m disconnected, I\'m talking.Mm-hmm.I feel the air.Mm-hmm. Do you know why you felt disconnected? Did you feel that in the session? Last session?Yeah.Mm-hmm.Yeah I felt it.We both missed the opportunity to discuss it.I felt it, but at the same time I was, you know, driving and discussing, and talking, talking, talking. So -And I was caught up in that also.Mm-hmm. So but I did [feel that at various times] (ph). That I\'m disconnected. And I think it\'s also a situation, I think familiar to me to be in this kind of situation.Mm-hmm.So -Well it\'s what you were talking about.Yeah. That\'s where I am with James.And so here we are.And it\'s true.What feels - I\'m sorry.I\'m sorry.Go ahead.And I know it\'s very hard for me to be completely authentic. Or intimate. And this is a (inaudible at 0:13:54.9) being married. Intimate. [0:14:00.5](Long pause from 0:13:57.8 to 0:14:29.0) And I don\'t know what to say.You know, as you were sitting there, the thought came to my mind, because you had used the word driving before.Mm-hmm.And the thought came to my mind that in sessions like the last session, you were driving with a map. I wasn\'t quite sure what it was. But I could certainly kind of get caught up, I was in the back seat, if you will.Mm-hmm.And you were driving with a map. And I feel like asking you these questions I just took the map away.Mm-hmm.And now you\'re stopped on the road. And where to go now? Does that in any way describe?Yeah it\'s fine. Because I was also talking about physically driving. Literally driving. Last time. Yeah I don\'t know. I don\'t know.Well if you can, if you can put into words, any of what it is that you\'re feeling right now. That\'s the place to start. You feel it\'s a familiar space.It\'s a familiar space that I, this is not familiar space. Where I was five minutes ago (inaudible at 0:15:47.0) familiar space.What\'s the difference?Familiar space is when I can be detached from my feelings and pretend that I\'m talking about it. [0:15:59.9]Okay. Okay. And now what\'s the -And now I can\'t pretend.Uh-huh. And what does that feel like?Scary. Uncomfortable. And confusing. But at the same time like I feel uncomfortable, but it\'s not necessarily that I don\'t want to be there. Right. But what I was saying now I\'m, it\'s also what I always do. I always look for something positive.You look for something positive?To convince myself. That it\'s very hard for me also to make decisions. Because I try to convince myself that there is, that it\'s okay.Right.That there\'s something positive about it.Whereas -And not to [necessarily convince me] (ph) what it is I really want.Uh-huh.Try to put other people\'s voices or different kind of - I think very much it\'s like I don\'t trust my own feelings. Or my own instinct. In my mind I do. In my heart I don\'t.Right. Well it would be hard to trust feelings if you\'re disconnected from them. If they\'re far away.Mm-hmm. I know that I\'m (inaudible at 0:17:55.9) But I\'m afraid of expressing negative feelings. [0:18:03.2]Is there something you were thinking about saying?Now?Yeah.Even like to be, confront, like it is you confront me with that.Uh-huh.And I\'m feeling, I\'m a little bit mad. And I\'m a little bit confused.Uh-huh. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? About what makes you mad?I think I don\'t want to be in this situation when I have to confront my feelings. Because it\'s, I don\'t know how to do it. It\'s so hard.It\'s very hard to do.And I guess I have a lot of negative, a lot of aggression, which is something that I don\'t know how to execute or to express my aggression.Mm-hmm.And sometimes I do it just being a little bit cynical. Or being a little bit, kind of denial. Kind of like I\'m putting myself away.Mm-hmm.And it\'s interesting, because we had a discussion in my school, three days ago, with a social worker that I work with.Mm-hmm.And we were talking about my director. Since there are a lot of problems. And all of a sudden she told me this," You know you\'re very angry. And I\'m surprised because it\'s not what, that\'s not the message that I got from you before." And it hit me that I\'m angry and nobody knows that. [0:20:07.9]Not even you.No not even myself.That\'s a good example.Yeah and it just happened three days ago.Uh-huh.And I\'m really afraid of expressing these kind of feelings. Especially when I feel, oh my God, where I am now in my life. And it could be in control. Or -It\'s a paradox, though. You know? Because in some sense it\'s the only way to be in control. Or to make a real decision. Is to allow yourself to be confused.Mm-hmm.And misdirected for awhile. Or I shouldn\'t say misdirected, without direction for awhile. That\'s hard to hold on to, I think. That information.Well I feel like after so many years almost in everything, there was no like misdirection. I know, like I know where I\'m supposed to go but I\'m not going there.Why do you know where you\'re supposed to go? What does that mean?It means that I can\'t constantly put my feelings on hold.I didn\'t hear one word in there you kind of what?Put my feelings -You put your feelings on hold.On hold. And -That makes it very hard to make a decision. [0:22:00.3]Yes. And it also (inaudible at 0:22:04.0) Yes. And it\'s in every aspect of my life.Mm-hmm. I believe that.It\'s like I don\'t know what is right and what is true and what is not true. And I\'m afraid that you know, in 15 minutes I\'m going to be numb again.You\'ll come back on Wednesday.Yeah but I have life in between.You do have life in between. What you said, in 15 minutes, do you mean something in the session might happen or just because -No just because -- you\'re going to revert to the way you\'ve been.Mm-hmm.Well that\'s true. That will happen. But you have a moment now.But it\'s like, I feel like I have no idea what I really want. I have no idea. But it\'s-[0:24:00.3]Well I mean a moment ago you were talking about feeling mad and confused. And my suggestion is for us to rather than think about all the decisions you have to make in your life, let\'s stay in the moment and deal with the feelings that are here right now. And that might put things in perspective a bit.Mm-hmm.Is there anything else that you\'re feeling right now?Pleasant.Mm-hmm.Um. (Long pause from 0:24:37.4 to 0:24:54.3)Now, when you look off -Yeah.Where are you?I thought about the fact that that so many times - that okay - I just saw myself walking on the street. Just on the way here or [somewhere hanging out before I go inside] (ph) to work. Thinking almost everyday that walking here is not what I\'m supposed to, is not what I\'m supposed to do. Or supposed to be. I\'m not happy.Walking anywhere?Walking, yeah it\'s more, I think it\'s more familiar to me with going to work. Going to work. Yeah. I\'m not happy.You\'re not happy. [0:26:00]And -And then what happens?And so many times, on so many occasions I feel (inaudible at 0:26:10.5). Sometimes it\'s stronger than others, but the voice, that I\'m not happy (inaudible at 0:26:18.4) change. But I don\'t do anything about it. Like time goes by.Well what happens when you feel the feeling? When you\'re aware of being unhappy, what happens next? Inside.When I\'m really aware of it I\'m getting aggressive. I feel like my body. Is I\'m getting edgy.Tense.Tense. Edgy. And I\'m tense with the people around me.Uh-huh.Edgy and I feel very judgmental about everything as I do it in (inaudible at 0:26:52.2) And (inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:26:54.7) about myself.About yourself.Yes. Like why do I do it. And also with my private life. It\'s the same with James. When I\'m all the time aware of it, I\'m not happy.Mm-hmm.It\'s the same. I became very edgy. And cynical.Mm-hmm.And critical.Mm-hmm.Also with myself. But that\'s the rare moment when clear.It\'s not always that clear.No.No.Most of the time it\'s not that clear. It\'s just in between. Like the twilight zone when I feel that something is wrong.Right. Something\'s amiss.Something is missing. I\'ve missed something. But it\'s not that obvious that I can react -You can pinpoint it.Yeah. I can say okay this is what I -And do you think that James has a sense when things are amiss with you in that way?No. No.You don\'t.No. I don\'t think it is. [0:28:00.7]That sometimes you have this aggression or edge -I think that he has, he has his own issues with. I wish, no (inaudible at 0:28:13.1). He has, he know when I\'m aggressive, we call it, that I can be disconnected from him.He has said that though.Yes.So then he is aware of something.No he is aware of that. He\'s not aware, he sees that completely as something that always has to do with him.Oh. I see.And that\'s not the case.And in a way, that must be very frustrating to you because really if it\'s true that in the moment you\'re disconnected, really it\'s much more about you.Mm-hmm. It is. And when we do get to, when I do get to talk to him about it, most of the time I\'m really frustrated. Because I don\'t get what I want. I don\'t get what I want because I\'m not very clear. To him.Uh-huh. Uh-huh.And it\'s very easy to get too emotional.Uh-huh.And too emotional in a way that I just don\'t want to have the discussion anymore. Not necessarily emotional and crying. Or emotional like because that actually might be good.But it\'s not even that.No. It\'s more like I just don\'t want to - I\'m frustrated.Yeah. I was just going to say that.Because he\'s very quickly frustrated. And he\'s much more - he\'s emotional.Mm-hmm.And for him there\'s always the bottom line. (Inaudible at 0:29:52.9)Right. Right. But really the bottom line would be that the two of you could express clearly what it is that you wish.Mm-hmm.But that\'s very hard to do. [0:30:04.4]It\'s also, you know, I just think in a way I just separate from him. I (inaudible at 0:30:10.0). When you say the two of us, I\'m like two of who? In a way I, physically not very much in the picture. And that is true in the last month.Uh-huh.Since we came back. And he\'s on my mind as an issue. Or as something that I have to deal with. Make a decision about. And not partner. Not a lover.I was going to say he doesn\'t sound like a lover.No. And it\'s almost, and I remember those times, and it\'s almost like when we were away last weekend, and when I like someone or I don\'t like someone I really don\'t care. Which is, I don\'t really care what people say.I\'m sorry. When you like someone -Okay. I felt like I really need kind of like the - I was looking for a group because they were (inaudible at 0:31:21.5) people. I was looking for the group approval of him. In a way. Which wasn\'t the case before.Uh-huh.And I was talking to [Cheryl], and I said, what do you really think about him? Or what do people think about him? And she was, and everybody always tell me that I\'m, lately I\'m doing such a harm to him in the way I describe him.You\'re doing an injustice to him.Yeah. I do an injustice.You\'re not fair to -No.Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well maybe the group\'s feelings are substitute for your feelings.Yeah well, and yeah that might be true. But I really don\'t know how to, I think I really don\'t know how to reach a point where he can understand me. It\'s like I don\'t know how to reach you. [0:32:24.1 ] (inaudible).Do you feel that I\'m not understanding you right now?No I do. I feel that you do.So you\'ve reached me today. (Long pause from 0:32:32.0 to 0:32:51.0) Did that, did my comment send you away?No. Maybe in way. It is but I was also thinking about the fact - I feel like we haven\'t really, I\'m having about everything I have this time frame that\'s (inaudible at 0:33:07.4) on Tuesday. I\'m feeling there\'s so many things that I want to be able - And you know I just need in a way to let go. To let things happen the way they are. But -But you feel it, you feel the pressure.Yes. Now I felt it, I don\'t feel it that much. I\'m more, I\'m truly looking forward to it. Almost in a way that I feel it might be a denial as well. It\'s going to be all nice and fun.Uh-huh.And it\'s not necessarily that\'s going to be the case. It\'s going to be part of it. But if we\'re also going to talk about the future, having kids, or if we\'re going to work it out. Or not.Mm-hmm.And I\'m numb about that too.Mm-hmm.And you know it\'s like also I know when people - it\'s so easy for me to, I\'m not exactly sure what I\'m going to say, but it\'s so easy for me to see other people\'s problems and what they\'re supposed to do. But it\'s so hard for me to see my own. And that\'s a shame. But how you can be so stupid about one thing and so not about other things? [0:34:23.2]And you know I felt about it like, I don\'t know how often I talk about it here, but I always say to myself that I need structure. That I need frames.The map.Map. Working with people. Doing something that basically just will let me not think so much about myself.Uh-huh. I wonder if it is that good structure and being around certain kinds of people you have a positive interaction with, if all of that kind of keeps you from feeling numb and scared and indecisive.It does. When I\'m with the right people, when I do stuff that I like, it does. Mm-hmm.You even chose a very structured therapy.What do you mean?Um -The way I -You know you chose something with a very clear ending.Oh. Yeah which I\'m not so happy about. [0:36:06.5](chuckles) Can you say more about that?I\'m definitely afraid of the fact that in 20 sessions it\'s going to be just a beginning and all of a sudden and I would feel more attached to you. And I would feel more the need of you as well. Not just the attachment. And all of a sudden I\'ll be, I don\'t know, it\'s going to be back to where I was before. But I don\'t feel numb here. And not necessarily more secure.It\'s a risk. It\'s certainly a risk. I think of any kind of an interaction but of an interaction that will stop a relationship when you go in knowing that the ending is in sight. It\'s a real, I think it\'s a real risk.Mm-hmm.But my sense is, is that even if you might be attached or lonely at the end, that hopefully we can have made something of the remaining sessions. So that you\'re not back where you started.Mm-hmm.You know. It might be hard to imagine that now. But I agree it\'s a very hard part of this therapy. Maybe even the hardest part.I didn\'t really thought about it till now. Because it\'s still, it seems to me we have a lot of sessions to do. [0:38:02.1]We do have a lot of sessions. Yeah.But I, it\'s true in so many ways I\'m looking for a frame. Structure. In my own, when I\'m supposed to do my own things. Like when I\'m creative with my art, I can\'t do it if I don\'t have a purpose. I can\'t do it if I don\'t know how, what is it that I\'m supposed to do.Mm-hmm. I want to say to you two things. On the one hand, you know, I mean everybody needs structure. I don\'t want you to think that -I know that.Everybody needs structure.I know that. But I put so much in it.Right. And so the other thing that I wanted to say is, for you, it seems to me that one of the questions is what is it that\'s so, you know the word that came up to my mind was terrifying, I don\'t know if that\'s what you feel -Mm-hmm.But what is it that\'s so threatening about lack of structure? You know, what is it that\'s going to happen? Or does happen if you don\'t have structure?Usually I just don\'t do anything. That\'s the case. And when I don\'t do anything, it means that there are problems in different ways. You know. Technically there is no work. There is no money. Then ABCD (inaudible at 0:39:56.3) think about it.Just stay in bed all day.I can be there. I can stay in bed. Watch TV. Be extremely passive. [0:40:07.1]And what does it feel like to you when you\'re that passive?I don\'t like myself. At the beginning, I\'m okay. After awhile, I feel pretty bored. I feel pointless. Almost like death. In a way. In a dramatic way. But I feel like there is [nano] (ph).Sound a little hopeless.Yeah.No wonder you want structure.(long pause from 0:41:07.3 to 0:41:33.7) But it\'s also, I feel like I have the need to - Because what I feel now when I\'m talking about it, it\'s so many different areas in my life. I can talk about work. I can talk about James. I talk about (inaudible at 0:41:47.8). I feel like I need to stop to focus. Or to try to, because what happened to me then is I\'m getting confused and I\'m just getting tired of it.Right.And that brings me to be passive and numb. [0:42:05.1]Okay. Well I\'m glad you told me. So here\'s a focus. Here we are. Okay. What does it feel like to have me ask you all these questions? In a structuring kind of way?At first I rejected. I felt that like my first reaction would be, don\'t judge me. Don\'t interfere. Don\'t -Uh-huh. Do you feel judged?No. I felt, in the beginning, that was my impulse. Yes. I felt when you started talking about the fact that you felt disconnected from what I said.Your experience about it but that doesn\'t touch me.Yeah. And -I didn\'t mean it as such.But it feels powerful.Yeah.It feels powerful. So meaningful. And it helped me. That you\'re asking questions. I\'m not used to it. Also in my life. I\'m used to people, my friends, expressing their opinion.It\'s a bit different.But I don\'t necessarily used to - Yes and no. I mean I\'m much more vocal in my relationships. I\'m more the one that see and said. And talk about it. What I see. With my current relationships. First with James and [Anna]. Colleagues are different.But it\'s a, and I know that my first reaction always when people say to me that, express their thoughts or feelings that surprise me. Judging. It\'s a judgment. [0:44:40.8]Oh.And then it doesn\'t really feel that way for too long.Mm-hmm.But that\'s the first.That\'s the first thing.Feeling.You know -But I\'m actually I\'m happy that you\'re doing it. Because I\'m not necessarily happy at the moment but I think and not because of you, just because of what it brought up to me, but I think I need it. That\'s what I feel. I need, help to make myself in a point where I haven\'t. And it\'s very hard for me to do it without someone from the outside as you are, challenging me about it. Asking questions. Tell me what you feel. [0:46:19.1]You know, unfortunately, I have to interrupt you now. And time is up. But we can try and pick up where we\'re leaving off.Okay.On Wednesday. On Wednesday we\'re meeting at, Wednesday the 20th, we\'re meeting at nine. And then the 27th, I hope that we can, I\'ll have to confirm with you next week, but I\'m hoping that we can meet at 12:30? The next week is nine.Yeah.And the 27th, let\'s try it for now at 12:30. [0:47:07.6] (end of audio)', "All right, so let me just kind of review last time.All right.Okay, oh you said the Zoloft seemed good but then you got sick and couldn't keep anything down.Yeah.So you went off the week, felt that this helped, you feel more calm and it's helped the panicky feeling and you've had some stressors going on with your brother coming to stay with you, SSI was being viewed and [INAUDIBLE].I'm okay with that, that part where they go over, they just passed the new review.Oh good.So I'm happy.You got your SSI, okay, that's good.Well, I just had one bad thing happen and it kind of affected my medicine again when I had to start again. I don't know what happened to me a long time ago when I was starting to have problems because I think there's something the doctors just aren't getting because when they see anything about depression, they tend to throw everything out in the garbage and just say oh well she's....Right.So I'm having problems where I feel like lead and I'm in pain all the time and sometimes I can't think and I used to get spasms like really bad. Sometimes I still do, like in the whole upper body. It's so hurtful like when I first started getting sick and this was years back I'd get it all along the spine, all the muscles would cramp up and I'd be like this and in pain and it hasn't happened for a while. I was in about the fifth week of taking the Zoloft and I'm not blaming it but I wanted, I should have called and asked you if I should continue. I went into such a spasm, it felt like somebody chucked like a spear through my back. Right into the back and like into here and all the muscles in that part of the body, the upper, they were tighter and tighter and tighter and it hurt so bad, I just felt like dying, I felt like I was being crushed and what it feels like to me is hard to explain, it's like something in my head and something goes down my spine because that's where all your nerves are. It feels like something shoots through there and then I go into spasms and I was in so much pain and the only thing I was thinking of, it sounds crazy, I don't know if this makes sense, my body feels lousy most of the time and when I'm taking medicine and I start to feel good, just I was thinking, I was doing the Zoloft, doing pretty good and I start to be, what I call normal, trying to do all the chores, trying to do the running around because I feel like I can handle it and then I think it was just too much for my body and, or it could have also been the thing with my brother and everything just, I was doing a lot and then that hit.[INAUDIBLE], too much tension or pressure, you think it might kind of trigger it?I'm thinking it might. I mean originally it started off when there was emotional stress, bad relationships and I used to get that attack going down my spine, but that's when I first started getting sick anyway. It was years ago but I had something happen with my brother then where somebody got shot. I had the truck accident, I got hit by a big truck, after that I always started having this problem where someone would confront me and I'd get that, you know, stunned panic thing. That's when it all started but I haven't had those bad spasms for a long time and that was just, I mean had it to where even the next day I couldn't get up and if I did, it was like threatening to do it again, and I was scared and I really didn't take my medication during that time. What I did do, I don't know if I should have not, but it worked, there was something, I had a [INAUDIBLE] in the closet. I had them from sometime way before and they were old but I took it to relieve that muscle spasm and I just stayed in bed with a heating pad and just rested. I had to be, like for three days, and then after...Wow.Because even the third day I said, I'm getting up, like I can't lay here, you feel like you're wasting your life. You know, you get up and it still hinted like it wanted to come back and something in here wanted to twist. Even this morning, just a hint, like not as bad as, but I was scared to even move and then after that, knots, you could actually feel the spot where it actually, I guess first, but then you're like real sore, you feel like you got beat up.Right.So I ended up in bed for almost a week and I didn't take my medicine and then even went into the next week and I didn't. I said lately though I feel kind of starting to feel so mopey where I'm not really doing nothing so I started taking it again. I'm not blaming it but I don't know if it's because I started to feel too good and do too much.I don't know. I mean, I...So...I think the fact that you've had it predating this, I kind of don't think it's the medication.Okay, because I feel like when I push my body. I'm always thinking the medication is masking the problem that they're not getting for some reason.Uh-huh.And, you know, it's making me feel good but I'm really still pushing myself. I don't know if that's it but that's what I was feeling.You've seen doctors in the past like for fibromyalgia, things like that?My problem is I'll get a good doctor, which I've got to get out of the clinic, because I found a good doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was helping me. He says there is a reason you have this chronic fatigue and all this stuff and we're going to find it. One believes it had to do with that past infection I might have had with the Epstein-Barr, but because so many people end up having the antibodies, they just kind of, he went away, he believed in that and he was helping me with stuff and then you get a new doctor who's like oh well that's just all in your mind, maybe you should see your psychiatrist for stuff like that. And like I've been going all these years. I know that I physically have problems, like even lately my heart's been pounding more. I've been getting like where it starts to speed up. I wake up in the middle of the night and it's just like I wake up suddenly and my heart is pounding or when I'm lying on the bed I can feel the bed pounding.So what else is-It's scary.So aside from this one episode which sounded like it was a bad one.Yeah.Do you feel overall the Zoloft has been helpful?I felt like it had and it was the only one that I could take for a longer period of time.So, I mean if your theory's right, so maybe what you need to do is to take it but to try and gradually increase your activity in moderation so it's not like, you know, such a shock for your system that's not used to doing a lot because you've been, you know, I don't...That's the problem with the chronic fatigue thing as far as what I've been following, even online a lot about it...Yeah.All the symptoms I have except for, I think the cold feeling, feeling cold or something. They say you have to pace yourself because then you'll get good days and you'll feel good.[INAUDIBLE] make up for lost time.I wonder if that's been happening all these years.Yeah.I have a few good days and then I end up in bed and that's why I was going to the Wellbutrin, to get me out of bed like when I feel lethargic.Right.So it's crazy, it's like a cycle. I'm up and down and I'm not necessarily feeling depressed. These are time when, at lot of times I was tired and still when things were good but this time it was, yeah emotionally, it could have been just as well my brother, feeling like I'm obligated and I've got other things.What happened with the brother in the end?Well we decided I'll let him stay two days a week. He'll come over and he'll stay at my mothers. Now she's not supposed to have anyone living there. I don't want her to get in trouble, but if he's there like a few days and they think he's just going in and out because she likes his company anyway.So he's going to officially be like...Well what happened, it's a terrible, it's a weird situation. He was living with this woman who's not quite right herself and there was an incident with the son. He attacked my brother. He's got autism, the son, and he disrupted his thinking or something and he went off on my brother and went and pulled a knife. And she's saying that you can't be here because [NAME OTHER] is going to go to jail if you come back because they said you've got to be separate so he has an address but he's kind of temporarily in limbo and my brother's got problems too where he's on antidepressants and it's just messed up and I don't...Does he spend more time with you than he has in the past?He'll just maybe like Thursday and Friday night so the way I can cope with it is, we get movies and we make pizza or something where we make it like it's a child coming over and you have something to do fun and then it's not stressful for me and I felt relieved but then I've got the ex husband calling me. He went away to prison for stupid little things like fighting with my, it's just a crazy mess, that's probably why I'm not right. [NAME OTHER], my youngest son has a biological father but [NAME OTHER] my ex husband raised him because he's dad to everybody but he always gets into stupid trouble, motor vehicle, this and that. This time he went after [NAME OTHER] dad and now he's in there. Now he wants to come back to my house. He always does that to me. That's because I've always mothered him. You know, when he lived on his own, do you have, does dad have enough groceries, dad needs a ride, now dad comes to me like he's my son and I think the day I had this spasm if I remember, he might have called me the day before.[INAUDIBLE], yeah.Yeah, because I'm like, oh my God, I want to help but yet it's such a heavy burden to take care of all these grown people when I'm trying to get well myself.It's really interesting. You know, a lot of people in America suffer from low back pain. I know that's not what you're having.I have disc problems thought.There was a, it was very interesting, there's a lot written about people who have chronic back pain, when they, it says carrying a big load, a big burden...Yeah.And it's addressed, you know, therapy or whatever, do they realize even if that's what contributing.Yeah.Is they get a great relief from the pain. It's just interesting, I mean it's like you talk about this guy being this big burden, then he calls, then he gets a spasm.Yeah.I mean, they may be related.That too many, there's just too many going on.So did you say yes or no to him?I kind of just didn't answer. I said I'm not supposed to have anybody here, that's my thing. I don't want to lose my rent, you know, and I left it in the air and then he goes well I don't have any other place. Then I guess I shouldn't have said it but I said well you try to find a place, I said and see what happens as a last resort, I says I'll think about it and I says if you do come, you have to find a place. Now that kind of said yes to him I think.Yeah, I'm sure that's what he heard.And I'm sorry I said it and at that same time, you know what causes me to feel like that spasmy thing too, saying no because then I feel heartbroken like what's going to happen to that person because he's so needy.Well, I mean, there are shelters...I don't know.There are shelters in the world, you know, there are people, places to go.I don't want to take a chance, like, I wouldn't mind if he came and it took maybe six weeks at the most, you know, find a job, save up, get a place, but is that going to happen, that's the thing. It hasn't happened before but then he had problems before, you know.Yeah.He's got this all out of the way. I'm hoping he'll just, and it's not even me. I wouldn't even associate with him at all if it wasn't for the kids. Gosh [INAUDIBLE], you know it's like if it wasn't for them, because they love him, especially the little guy, I wouldn't even answer the phone. Not that I hate him, you know, but it's just like I don't need the extra, so I was thinking today to just put a block on the collect calls and just let it ride. Okay, you can't contact me. If you get out and show up then I'll have to deal with it but otherwise, you know.It's a lot easier to deal with it when he's not showing up with all his stuff by your door.Yeah.Well, I tell many people, he can always blame me. I have a lot of times, I've heard people saying to just tell him that your psychiatrist said you can't handle it, that there's too much stress and you're not supposed to do it.I feel like it's killing me, I really do. It's...[INAUDIBLE]The weight problem I think is a symbol of all the weight that I feel because I'm thinking that if I can clear all this up, I'd probably slim down. I went away for a week to this retreat and I lost 20 pounds right away.Yeah.So it kind of...Well you were stressed puts weight on you, you know the whole, and the [INAUDIBLE] cortisol, that abdominal....Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] I can't even breathe.You kind of, you know what, you have to think of it not as you're saying no to him but that you're saying yes to your family and to yourself that you need to be healthy, everyone counts on you.Yeah.And if you are like, you know, in bed for three days because the burden is too much and you go into spasms, that's just, you know...Yeah.I know that you're very giving and forgiving.Yeah.But you also have to think about your ability to function as a mother if you're totally bedridden.Sometimes I get trapped too because I'll think, well he's going to be here and even though he doesn't contribute a real lot, even just the help with lifting things, fixing things, or a little bit of extra money, that kind of makes me feel like I'm going to feel better.Right. If there's ways, only you can know the risks and the benefits and it sounds like your first reaction is probably the true reaction.I thought I was going to have a stroke or something, that's how bad it was, you know.Yeah, yeah. I think you've got to listen to your body, it sounds like it knows more than your brain sometimes.Yeah, yeah. So...You have to listen to yourself and, you know, you can say it in a nice way, I'd love to but I just can't, my doctor said I can't handle the stress or it's just too much or whatever, you know.Yeah.But you know, sometimes you have to say no because you've got to take care of yourself. They count on you, they truly have no one else to count on.Yeah.You know.That's true. It's just too many things mixed up with it. I haven't done him a favor I guess by helping him in the past because he always depends on me.That's the thing, if you see that it helps a person get back on their feet but if it just....The only thing that helps is when, this is an awful thing to have to live like this, but when I don't help and he goes off and stays with the wrong people, that's when he'll get back in to doing things he shouldn't, like drugs and drinking and that's where, why he ends up there and it's almost like I feel like he comes with us, he goes to church, he gets back on track but it's almost like if he's not with me, he's not on track so I feel like what do you do with that, like you know, you feel like you're helping him to stay on the right track and stay away from the wrong people.If you were signing up for a six week stint, if that's a lifetime stint, then it's a little bit less.I'm not married to him anymore...Right.For twenty something years, and I can never win, so...Tell me, now you get your Neurontin, [INAUDIBLE] Wellbutrin enough until [DATE] and Zoloft we are kind of holding off. How are you taking it now?Well I was taking it for that, I got into like the fourth or fifth week and then, I think lately when I started up again, I'll take it like for a few days and then take a break for a day or two. The unfortunate thing is like, all the medications end up the same where I take them but I have to like skip a day or two. It seems like when they build up I feel like it's too much.Right, you've always had that where you kind of...Yeah.Adjust your dose.It's like I thought this was going to be the magic bullet, you know, where I could just keep...Well, you know, this is a one time episode. I wouldn't say that has anything to do with the Zoloft, especially with all these things that you're telling me. You know, I think you have to kind of keep giving it a chance...Yeah.And maybe gradually increase the dose but you said you were feeling pretty good.That's what I figured. I was afraid to start it up again but I did but it's like okay, so I had it for about a month, that one week was out completely, maybe a week and a half, then I started again, took it three or four days, maybe forgot a day but still felt okay but that's what happens, I'll skip a day or two, even with the Neurontin, it helps me more when I skip a day or two, believe it or not. When I keep taking it, I just feel kind of weird. I'll skip a day or two, then I'll take it fresh again and then it'll really help me feel relaxed and sleep.So when you take Zoloft, how much do you take?Still the 50 I'm up to. I haven't gone up any higher really, that's the only thing.Now, the other meds you mail away, right?What?The other medications?No.Or you do them locally?Locally, yep.Okay, so you need everything. I think you're getting close to being out I believe. So I think we need to give you everything and you're just doing 50 mg. You never went higher?I wonder if I tried it the 75 or...Well [INAUDIBLE]I might have tried 75 and I think I might have gone up to 75 just before this happened because remember you said to try to gradually increase it but I don't think I got past like a day or two of that and then this, if I go back on 50, I could try to go up.I'll just write one to one and a half because I know you do things gradually. Okay and I'll give you refills.I just felt bad to have to come in and tell you this. I'm like here I am again with the medicine and not...No [INAUDIBLE]You know, I start it and stop and I don't mean to.But you know what, I think that, you know, again there's these other factors that play a role...Yeah.And you kind of have to, and I have to, no point in taking, if you have doubt about a medicine, you're not going to feel good when you're taking it, so you take your little break and go back on it.Yeah.You know, do it gradually again getting to get back. Are you back on now?Yeah. I'm on 50 so I could try to go up in maybe another week, you know, and try to go up and see what happens, but...Look it, if you're feeling okay on the 50, you don't have to go up.And this thing too, since I've been on this, I haven't been really taking the Wellbutrin much so I don't know if I should just keep it on hand or... I took it a couple of times with it but not regularly so I don't know what to do with that. That's like when I really get that lethargic thing where I'll take that to get me up. I don't know why that works.Well it is stimulating.And it is almost like a little speed effect.It is.So I take it for that reason and maybe I'll just leave it that way for now.That's fine.Yeah, just to keep, each day is so different and it's like I have to take what I need to take to get me through. It's like, or to function. There's days where I will just say, you know what, I've got to stay in bed and rest because I'm not going to be any good but I've still got to get all the work done.Right. Well, that's overwhelming too for one person to have to do everything.It is. The girls are not contributing like they should so, but...What a surprise huh?Oh gosh. I don't know how they can, my mother never asked me and she did everything but, I mean, if she had asked I would have done it. Kids are something else.All right, so I'm putting refills on. I usually see you about every couple, every month or, I'm thinking about a month so anywhere between four and six weeks is fine.Okay.Okay, Wellbutrin, Neurontin and Zoloft.Other things could have been a factor too because they went up a little on the Synthroid. I know that speeds your heart rate up so...Uh-huh.I don't know. That's where I'm confused. Too many doctors, too many switches.Well, you know the thing is...I've got to find some, one good guy or something to go to.So where are you going to be looking for another doctor?I don't even know where to begin. I really don't.Well if you ever want to bring in your Medicare list, I'll be glad to look and see if there are some names of people that I've heard are good.Yeah, okay. I just want somebody that'll listen and not just...Yeah, I know some doctors like that but I don't know if they're on the list or not.Yeah.So if you, like I said, if you want to you...I'll do that. I need help with it because I'm really getting discouraged and lot of me feeling off is because I get upset going there. When I go there and try to talk and they don't want to really...Well, the problem is that everybody-My blood pressure goes up.They're so overbooked that they don't have that much time.It's almost like they'll start into something, another doctor will come in and say, one doctor will want to help and has and then they'll like poo poo him and give me to someone else and they'll say oh you're depressed, oh well you need to just take more antidepressants and that's what I get.I have patients say they don't even tell the doctor because they don't want them to judge them based on that.I thought that way too.Yeah.[INAUDIBLE]They have to know eventually. All right, we're all set. I'll see you then in four to six weeks, okay?Okay.All right. Thank you and thank you for doing this.", '(3-minute silence) What I\'ve been thinking about, ever since it happened today, is, uhm, a conference I had with parents of a boy. And I al, I think I\'m, I was more upset by this conference and, and I don\'t know, I felt more helpless at it and I certainly felt very nervous during it and, uhm, just sort of incapacitated during it in a way that I rarely feel that strongly. And it just occurred to me now that, uhm, it must have something to do with the fact that the boy\'s father\'s attitude was very hostile and defensive. And it wasn\'t just that he was finding it hard to, well, understand what the position of the school is toward his son and there\'s really no need for him to be that hostile since the boy isn\'t doing badly, it\'s more sort of an emotional problem that he has had and he\'s been having therapy. But everything, everything should be going along fine. And it, and he\'s just so defensive about his position as what they\'re doing to him. So his technique was to immediately attack me and start asking me why did I do this, what did I mean by that. And I knew right from the start I should keep things in the conference general and, uhm, sort of not answer him in the way he was asking me because by answering him, I\'d play his game. And, and then that was just what I did. I just, I don\'t know, I just felt, well, completely powerless. And so I suppose I, I, I\'m upset partly because he was making me feel in a way that, rationally, I knew there was no need for me to feel. And then he was making me, or I was responding in a way that was exactly the opposite to the way I wanted to respond. (Pause)And the reason I think I\'m more upset by this one is partly because my supervisor was there during the conference. And she backed me up and agreed with me the way things went and just generally gave me support. And it\'s the kind of support that generally would help me feel that there was no reason for me to keep thinking about it and feel upset, since I knew she approved of what had happened. And this is the first time I\'ve had a conference with a hostile father. I\'ve had just a few conferences with fathers before and they\'ve, but they\'ve always been pleasant ones. And that\'s why I think it must have something to do with the fact that the father was there and my reacting to him, rather than just to the general situation that the parents had a different view of things than the school.Are you surprised?Not really but it didn\'t occur to me until just now that that was what was happening. I kept thinking, after the conference or even during it, that the reason I was upset was that the parents just couldn\'t hear what we were trying to say to them. (Pause) And I\'m further, I think I\'m further upset by something he did which I don\'t understand even now. Because uhm, I think the boy has had some emotional problem but as, as far as the school is concerned, uhm, although the school didn\'t really want to accept him, they, they were hesitant to and it was only because the parents really pushed it that they did, uhm, the boy is, right now, performing alright. And he\'s improving in his relationship with the other boys in the class so that just from what\'s happening at school, I can\'t see why the parents would be terribly concerned. And it would be more their concern, I should think it would be more, uhm, what should be done because of the therapy he\'s having. Or, well, I don\'t really, I\'ve never had this experience either, of having a child who has gone to therapy but I just don\'t understand quite the way their attitude is taking. And before, even before we had the conference today, the father made an appointment with the headmaster at the school. And he didn\'t even know then what we were going to talk about. So I, I don\'t know, unless he just didn\'t like the report that was written on the boy, that I wrote on the boy. I can\'t under, otherwise understand why he would have made this appointment ahead of time, before he even knew how things would go during the conference. (Pause)And this is another case where there\'s such a discrepancy between what I know and what I feel. Because the whole way this father performed in just the fact that the boy has the problems he has, would suggest that the father is in some way very insecure. And, uhm, if I had been at all confident I could have very easily handled the s, not, well, not very easily but I wouldn\'t have taken things personally and I wouldn\'t have fallen into the kind of trap that he, he was laying for me. And yet, still, I was feeling very defensive in return and feeling that he was the more powerful one and that probably he was right. Or, I mean, know, I knew that I didn\'t think he was right but just somehow I felt I had to answer to him, I guess that\'s it.(5-minute silence) I was just wondering, too, uhm, aside from the fact that the conference started out making me feel I had to justify, well, just taking the report, which they began with, things that I had said in it. Because they kept saying, "Well, why did you say this?" Or, "What do you mean by that?" Uhm, there were 1 or 2 things that I had decided I did want to say to the parents during the conference, which really directly involved sort of the attitude that they had toward their child and the kind of standards that they were teaching him to have for himself. And I always find this very hard to say to a parent because some, because sometimes I\'m probably thinking, well, how do I really know, myself, anyway. And, well, I don\'t know, it\'s just such a personal thing for a parent, that I much prefer sort of skirting around it and not really saying it. And I knew, in this case, I\'d have to say it fairly simply and generally but directly. And just somehow, again, I think I could have done it with just the boy\'s mother but the fact that his father was there too, I, I just kept avoiding bringing it up until finally I had to. And then I just couldn\'t think of a way to put it so I could say it.What was it you wanted to say?Well, just mainly that the boy is a child and he can\'t decide everything for himself. They, they often will let him decide what he\'s going to do and, uhm, who he\'s going to be with and, and they are constantly saying how they like him to be masculine and mature. And just from the way he\'s behaved and from what they\'ve said, I\'ve gotten the impression that they expect a lot from him. Or, if he says that he wants to do this or that, they take it on as literal, on the, or the superficial value without realizing that often the boy is returning what they expect from him or like to have him be. And, uhm, I suppose I don\'t really know how to get at it so I wasn\'t too clear on how to say it. (Pause)The reason this is, was sort of an issue too is because, uhm, in the fall, uhm, his mother indicated that this boy was going to walk home alone. And for this age boy it\'s never been, I don\'t think any boy at that age had walked home alone before. So I had to ask my supervisor what the school\'s reaction would be. And it became an issue because the mother became defensive that the boy had wanted to and they had worked it out very carefully. And I had felt, since then, when the boy started walking home alone, he used to hang around a lot and just look very wistful. And whenever she\'d pick him up he\'d always look extremely pleased, when he first saw her. Although, I guess, to her he\'d always say, "Why did you come?" And act displeased. So it just seemed to me that if she would just be a little bit stronger in what she thought was right and not listen to him all the time, it might be better. And then there\'d been an issue over his saying he didn\'t want to play with other boys. And yet, in the classroom, he\'s extremely conscious of other boys and he\'ll much prefer to leave any activity just to socialize. And she finally said one time, that she thought that she had maybe listened to him to much and that if she just helped him to overcome whatever fears he had about playing with other boys outside of school, then he always had a good time. And this was a very new attitude on her part. But she doesn\'t really put all this together. And I wanted to make some general comment on what might help him so that he wouldn\'t be asked to make decisions he\'s not ready yet to make for himself. But I think I was afraid of saying anything. Despite the fact that I didn\'t really know how to say it, I was afraid to because somehow or other, implied in this, is a criticism of the parents.Well, from all that you say, it sounds as though you must feel quite critical of them.Well, I don\'t, I think it\'s defensive on my part, that I\'m feeling this critical. Because I, I think if they hadn\'t been so defensive, if they\'d somehow just been more open to, when they asked the school for suggestions, if they\'d been more open to them, because they did come to me first, asking, then, uhm, I don\'t think I\'d be so critical.My point is not that you\'re too critical or not critical enough, it\'s that I think that that frightens you, when you get critical or feel it, you know, because you\'re afraid it\'ll get out of hand. And therefore, you have to be very cautious. (Pause) From what you describe, it\'s hard to imagine that, if you let yourself feel what you\'re inclined to, you must have been very angry with the father today. But you describe as mostly having felt defensive but, ah, it seems to me this implies that you would, if you weren\'t afraid to, been very angry with him for behaving that way you describe. And I think you, when, when you describe feeling defensive, it seems to me it must be that you are afraid of, in control of your own feelings, that you have to keep them very much in check and be very cautious and careful, as you described.And right now, all I can think when you say this, is that I just had such an overwhelming fea, feeling of being powerless.To control the anger that, if you didn\'t squelch. It\'s very striking that you don\'t mention that you were mad at him, I think.I hadn\'t thought of it. Really, I thought only in terms of well, mad at him only because he was making me feel so defensive. But I suppose because what right would I have had to be mad at him unless he did something to me first. So that\'s why I\'m thinking of it that way. (Pause) But I\'m, when you say that, I\'m not sure what I was afraid I\'d do if I didn\'t control my anger. (Pause) Well, I suppose unless it would be that, without the fear, then I would lose control of myself and say things that wouldn\'t be acceptable for me to say as a teacher.For example?I don\'t know. (Laughs) Well, just sort of stop, well, I want to say faking it. I don\'t know, he just, (sighs) I just felt the whole time he was being so false and, and putting importance on things that really weren\'t really important and that he didn\'t really think were important but that was his way to attack the situation. And (pause) well, in fact I did make a comment that I made under stress but, uhm, I don\'t think I would have if I had had more control. Because at one point they were asking about their son\'s writing and, uhm, again, they felt I hadn\'t assessed it properly, that he didn\'t write as well as he could and I hadn\'t indicated this in the report. And, ah, they asked to see samples. And one of the samples, ah, happened to be a story he\'d written and the children had been given a choice of writing about a pet they have or one they used to have or one they would like to have. And this boy wrote, "My pet used to be a vulture." And when, when his father read this, I\'ve never seen such a look of shock on a parent\'s face. I know sometimes parents can\'t stand to think of their children sort of going towards things they consider violent or horrible like that. But this father\'s face just was unbelievable and I felt I had to say something because he, he just looked like he couldn\'t handle this. And so I said, "Well, he was just using his imagination." (Laughs) Which was obvious. And, ah, then my supervisor tried to make a joke of it and saying something that, "Would you think they really had a vulture at home?" Or something, I don\'t know. But anyway, the father was just still in a state. He just couldn\'t stand this. And uhm, so I said, "But he looked so shocked, that\'s why I said that." (Laughs) And again I was saying it because I felt I had to defend myself on something that was kind of obvious and stupid to have said. But, and I couldn\'t carry the joke because I was too involved in the whole thing. But, in a way, I was implying, again, a criticism on the father by saying that. And, ah, then the father\'s reaction was, "Well, the vulture\'s me." Which I guess was why he was so upset by it to start with. (3-minute silence)I th, I keep thinking, too, when I think about this conference, of the fact that, even though my supervisor and I agreed on what should be covered and, and how, well, not how to say it, that\'s the thing that bothered me. But, I don\'t know, we talked about it beforehand and I could talk to her about it and, and I felt I was making myself clear but during the conference, although I could judge the situations and understand what was happening, I somehow couldn\'t pull things together or put things into words. And it made me feel as stupid as if I couldn\'t even judge the situations. And so then I began thinking, when my supervisor was talking, well, I should be able to, I should have been able to put it into those words or see it in that way. So it was combination of feeling angry at the parents, mainly the father, and feeling angry at myself.Are you saying now you felt angry at him because I said so or because you did, in fact, feel it?Well, no, I felt it because I, well, I just can\'t quite see it the way you said it but I know I did feel angry at him. (Silence) If I\'m really honest, I think I said at, that, about being angry at them mainly because you had said that, regardless of how I felt.Afraid of me too?Excuse me?Are you afraid of me too?(Pause) I just somehow can\'t answer that. Because it\'s almost like I don\'t let myself look at it in that way so (silence) I almost make a separation, I don\'t quite understand what it is I do. But I can readily think I\'m afraid of what you might think of me. But somehow it seems different from just saying I\'m afraid of you because if I say it that way, that directly, then it doesn\'t make sense. (Silence)I was just thinking about this sort of roundabout way that I think. Because it does seem if I\'m afraid of what you think of me, then I am afraid of you. Or, if I was feeling very defensive toward the father today, that I always feel angry at anyone who makes me feel that defensive, so I was angry at him. And, and then, in thinking how I think to myself in this roundabout way, made me connect it to, how so often I have so much trouble when I\'m talking to other people saying something directly or, when I write, writing something directly. (Pause) It\'s almost as if I literally and figuratively can\'t face things directly, or people directly. (2-minute silence)It made me think of the, uhm, well, I guess I was thinking in terms of, if I had more courage or confidence, both, I could look at people, look at people in the eye or look at a situation directly and, well, I just began thinking of how I so often have to be encouraged or supported or praised or whatever.Well, you know, recently you have talked about another man that you spent a lot of your life with, who made you angry and scared you and frightened you, made you feel powerless and defensive and forced you to react in ways you didn\'t know or didn\'t want to and with whom you have a lot of trouble talking.(Pause) Again, I can know that the comparison is very true between the 2 situations, living with my father and then how I reacted today, but I don\'t feel the association. I don\'t know, something could, I could be looking on somebody else\'s life when I compare the 2. (Pause) And what I think I\'m finding out is that, no matter how frustrating it is when I know something that doesn\'t do me any good, it doesn\'t have any meaning for me unless the feelings I have can correspond with what I know. If they don\'t, then I might as well not know what I know. (Pause)Well, our time\'s up.', 'And is she better or worse?Uh, don\'t know what it\'s called. You know, um, I say the first thing before I forget any conversation or any part of this is, um, dreams, fitful dreams thatNightmares, you mean? No?Uh, I think night, um, nightmares are one of those things that make me want to get up and run out of the house. I don\'t want to be that strong. But it does[LAUGHING]. Okay.Yeah, but I\'m like, no, I\'m not claiming, claiming that, uh, but justUpsetting dreams?Yeah, I would say upsetting, but I don\'t know what the, uh, the, the context of the dream is, I can\'t remember what it\'s about, but it\'s enough toYeah.You know, wake me up and then I sit there all antsy about going back to sleep. So, you know how I was saying how, uh, I guess what, it\'s last, what has it been, a couple of weeks or so, that I just had no get up and, and go, you know. But whenYeah.I do make it out of the house, it\'s like when I get back home, I get to my, my favorite comfort zone and on the couch in the family room and I\'m, you know, there vegging out on TV and the dream, you know, the, how long I\'ve been dreaming, I really don\'t know, but it\'s like I\'m aware of them now, okay? Because it\'s almost like every hour I\'m, you know, I\'mAnd trying to remember might give us a hint.

When you say vivid, because it\'s, you know, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s real, it\'sHigh definition. [LAUGHING].Yeah. You know, I just started using my high def channels on TV [INAUDIBLE]. You\'ve got the stations turned to it.Yeah.I don\'t see, I didn\'t see any difference in it, but the only clarity he could show me was on the football field. See how green the grass is? Well, I don\'t watch football, so I could care less. But, I mean, I know there is a difference, but, uhNot what they make it out to be.Not that it\'s, yeah.I mean if you had a good TV to begin with, it\'sYeah.Yeah.I mean, hey, it\'s what, what I was watching before was clear. But, you know, so how long I\'ve been dreaming, I don\'t know, but it\'s definitely at a point of okay, and I\'ll say I\'ll spend a few minutes trying to figure what were you dreaming about, you know? I can\'t, I can\'tYeah.Pinpoint what is was I was dreaming about.Try to. Take notes or something because in your dreams you\'re trying to work out your problems.Okay.SoOkay.It\'s not really as simple as that butYeah.You know.As long as I\'m not taking an ax to my husband.Right. That is, or he to you.[LAUGHING].[LAUGHING]. Was this just happened more since we increased the Wellbutrin, you think?Um, I would, I\'d say yes, and I don\'t know. Yes to the partYeah.That I, I\'m aware, I seem to be aware of it now, but the I don\'t know is I don\'t really knowYeah.How, you know, how long I\'ve been dreaming. I never considered my, you know, I\'ve never really been a, a dreamer. I mean, you know, 1, 2.[LAUGHING].I mean, I mean at sleep dreams. I mean, I can daydream like I\'d like to be on that, on that there [INAUDIBLE]Well, everybody dreams, even if you think you don\'t.Right. Yeah.But once you start paying attention to it, you\'ll probably be able to remember some of it too.Yeah. And that is what I\'m saying, so yes and I don\'t know. Because, uh, if everybody dreams, I know I\'m not outside that norm, but I am more aware ofYeah.Of something. Because, you know, I guess when I wake up and I\'m kind of tossing and turning like what, what woke me up? You know, after I had ruled out, I know the foot isn\'t hurting anymore, you know, the back is, you know, it\'s, it\'s not bothering me, or is bothering me, then I startYeah.Kind of back tracking, okay, well, what is it, you know, okay, so.I have a whole folder full of dreams from post office people.Oh God.[LAUGHING]. You could imagine.Well, and I tell youIt covers everything.Um, huh, it does make me think.Yeah.It\'s reminding me of something, there is a, uh, huh, huhYeah.Retirement party that I was invited to. Maybe that is what I\'m antsy about? UmWho is that for? Oops.Uh, well, she\'s a, a, um, a neighbor family friend, just also happens to be postal, postal employee. Matter of fact, she was the one that retrieved me out of the hall when I had that panic attack.Yeah.And that, you know, that took me out of work. Um, and you say she, I mean, she\'s, she\'s friendly by all get out. I mean, I probably need, I need to call her because she\'s like, "Well, you know, I\'ve been there 40 years and been there to help you out through this and the other." Which, which she has. [INAUDIBLE].Yeah. When, when, when is the party?UhEh.The [DATE], this, this Saturday.Oh.Yeah, this Saturday. And I remember when I got the invitation, you know, it\'s RSVP, and I said, okay, I\'m not going to wait until last minute to do this, you know, I\'m going to do it and low and behold last minute was knocking on my door, you know. Another, uh, uh, friend because his, you know, [NAME OTHER], um, he used to be manager at [DEIDENTIFIED] there. He goes, well, [NAME OTHER] was wondering if you were coming, she didn\'t get your RSVP. And I\'m like, oh, dag nabit, that is the one thing I said I wasn\'t going to do, but, so.So you\'re going?Um, I\'ve made a commitment to go and I don\'t like breaking my commitments, so.[LAUGHING]. WellCome heck or high water.It\'s bitter sweet. [LAUGHING].Yeah, I know, you know. My husband bribing me, all right whose on that list because this is more of a personal, her personal family and, and friends.Oh, that good.Acknowledgement.So it\'s not going to be a bigYeah. They\'re, for her it\'s going to be big. But the one that they did for the postal, for postal employees was a luncheon and, you know, and I told her definitely not, I\'m not going to that one because I would\'ve, you know, I would\'ve seen, you know, my ex manager and other folks. I know I definitely didn\'t do that one. But, umWell, I mean, even if you see them or people bring up, just, just focus on the physical stuff, you know.Yeah, yeah.Then you limp in and out.Yeah, that won\'t be a problem.[LAUGHING].Believe me. And I\'ve been, have been, uh, walking at least 4 nights a week. And, um, go out to walk last night and my husband goes, "You\'ve been walking now for a few weeks and you\'re limping worse now." And I say, well, I, you knowYeah.It\'s worth explaining to you. I mean, you know, I think, I guess things get out of wack and it\'s a good day today and the next day it\'s like, because I pulled my heating pad out and I hadn\'t had that out in a couple of months. I pulled it out the other day. I\'m like, okay.Well, you got to constantly figure out what is too much, you know?Yeah. UmAnd using your old self as a comparison is not the way to do it. [LAUGHING].Yeah, you know. So, actually, I guess, I\'ve gotten new, putting new, new parameters that I\'ve got toYeah, you do.And I\'ve got it, you know, sort out. Because I know because it is, when I think, when I think back to, um, it\'s been years that I was [INAUDIBLE] burning it at both ends and putting a couple of matches in, in between those, um, those ends there trying to get itYeah. Well, if you, if you pay attention, I mean, I, when I, like if I know I\'m going to wax the boatUmhum.Or work down in the hull of the boat, which is actually leaningUmhum.Under the floor, I can now say, okay, I can do that for, you know, 15 minutesAnd thenOr waxing 20, if I go over 20 minutes, I can do that and go do something elseUmhum.Or rest for an hour or 2.Umhum.Go back and do 20 more.Umhum.But if I go over that, man I pay for it.Umhum.You just got to, it\'s got to get like that, you know. Walking, I don\'t even attempt that anymore.Umhum.Because, you know, if I go 2 blocks it\'s going to start on my back. But I can swim, thank God. But, you know.Yeah. I can\'t swim, so I got to lean toward, toward the walking. I, I, you know, I\'m trying, thinking that the walking, which I do enjoy it, um, because my husband and I some, you know, spend some 1 on 1 time outside of the house, we walk the neighborhood. UmYeah.I, I\'m his cool down walk because he\'ll get about 3 miles in at his pace, and then we, we get to [NAME OTHER] and her slower than snail\'s pace.Well, that is okay, yeah. [LAUGHING].[LAUGHING]. I figureThat is a better way than starting out with, I mean drop it back.Oh, yeah, that is, humum. I see the pace that he takes off and, oh my gosh, I mean, there is no way I can keep up with that one. But I was happy to, to have it, you know, it gives me something to look forward to, you know. OkayThat is good.I got to get up and, you know, get, get our walk in.Well, maybe you can\'t do it every single day.Well, I\'m, I\'m doing, um, Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So I may have to it, it might be those that the Sunday and Monday back to backYeah.That I have to give up. I need to do, um, you know, you\'re on that there worldly regimen of you, you know, every other day, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Because he doesn\'t walk on Saturdays, you know, he just because he\'s [AGE]? Yeah, he\'s [AGE]. I need, uh, I need to rest my body too. So I may have to cut it down to theYeah.To the 3 days and get thatI could swimRegimen up a little bit.I could swim 2 days in a row, but then I got to take the next one off.Umhum.Even though you feel guilty about it in a way you don\'t do it.Yeah. Yeah.It ain\'t worth it. [LAUGHING].Yeah, because I, you know, when, and my husband is, he\'s better at a, um, acknowledging where I am than I am because all, I\'m still in that trying to push myself too. Well, all we\'re going to do is we\'re just going to do a mile, you know, and it\'s a slow pace mile. Um, so even last night we were cutting it up because well, at some portion, depending on which way we go, we got an uphill. I mean, it\'s a slight uphill, but you can, you can tell the uphills. As soon as we started with the incline, up, let\'s, let\'s turn around and go back the other way, and we\'ll, we\'ll walk it out this way. And he\'s like, "Yeah, you know, are you hurting?" And I\'m, I won\'t answer. So, which is just as guilty as answering. He saysRight. You already did it, so you got the answer.[LAUGHING]. He said, "You wouldn\'t tell me if you were would you?" So, but.Yeah, I mean, in every arena it\'s up to you to tell the people, the kids, him, okay, I\'ve reached my limit.Yeah.You know.Yeah.And nobody cares. I mean, uh, because they know you\'ve got to protect yourself.Yeah. And then, then, like I say, they\'re actually better. They\'re better for me than I am for me, you know. Okay, come on, stop, no we\'re not going to do that.Right. [LAUGHING].So, you know, I just got to just try and pay attention to the dreams a little more and see if I can remember what it is I\'m dreaming about. And, uh, just say get through this phase of recuperating where I am. You know, the dreams they, they did kind of bother me because I can get, like I say, there was, uh, a startling, you know, kind ofWell, they\'re crazy.Yeah.I mean you just got to accept that.Yeah.[LAUGHING].Yeah. I\'m like, okay, so what is going on. I, I obviously didn\'t dream the magic 6 numbers, so, it\'s the lotto or.Yeah. Well, you never know.Yeah.My daughter swears she did do thatAnd she did it playingAnd hit 5 numbers.Oh, yeah, okay. And couldn\'t remember what that sixth one was, huh? [LAUGHING].I guess not, you know. [LAUGHING].Yeah.She swears she dreamt them, though. [LAUGHING].Hey.I guess it could happen.Yeah. Yeah. Anything is possible. So, it\'s all, you know, hanging at the, the Deplin, I need, that is what I need, I needed some more.Oh, okay.I need another script for the Deplin.All right, so far, our friends we got the Deplin 5, you\'re taking a half of an Abilify.Half of the Abilify.Which is about 2 mg. Lexapro, 20, Wellbutrin 300.Yeah, because that is 2 of those. And the, uhOne thingI think the Ambien I take that with a, I don\'t know, it must be like a, like caffeine for me now because I, I\'m waking up out of the sleep.Well, you may just be anxious about theYeah.Going to this party.The affair.This is the, this is the first thing you really did with, that might involve post office people and all of that.Yeah. You know, you know, being on a larger scale, I still, you know, I still meet with my coworker, we try to do lunch once a month. And, uhThat is 1 person?Yeah.Oh.And it\'s just 1. Maybe, maybe 2, we just started with 2. But I see the second one at church, so that is not a, I mean, you know, she\'s common, common to me. But definitely no, no thread a nerve antagonist.[LAUGHING]. Well, were you close to retiring anyway?Uh, humum, no, no.No.That is 2016. I\'m going to have to get closer.You weren\'t closer. [LAUGHING].I\'m, I\'m, I\'m a youngster in the, uh, yeah, at 25 years in, but had to reach the age.Yeah.Age for regular retirement. But they did offer me, uh, this last year, I\'m still trying to like, you know, you got that skills and incompetent mode. My retirement is effected and he\'s sending me [INAUDIBLE] paper work. I\'m already off the roll, so why are you sending me [INAUDIBLE] paper work?Yeah.And where I am there is no working left hands [INAUDIBLE].I\'m going to give you this stuff because I don\'t need it.Okay.Discharge [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHING].Okay. Now, and you had, you had told me that one of them was kind of like, which one of the medicines is kind of like, uh, because I think I switched them from the day to the, is it the, uhThe Wellbutrin should be in the morning.The Wellbutrin should be in the morning.All other, yeah.Yeah. So I got the Wellbutrin and, uh, and the Lexapro. I\'m just taking those in the morning. And the, the Wellbutrin, the Lexapro, and the Deplin.Yeah, the Deplin is a, a vitamin.Like a vitamin, right. Yes, I\'m going to take those in the morning.A medical food.All righty. I need, I need, I need the food.[LAUGHING].Okay. So I need to get that refilled then.All right.And that in the morning. And I\'ll stay on this, on this regimen.Yeah, I think it\'s[INAUDIBLE].I think it\'s helped.Okay.We might be able to lower the Lexapro. But, you know, I hate, the other side of that is don\'t mess with success.', 'This is Wednesday. (Telephone ringing).(Answering telephone) Hello? Yes? (Audio break)(Inaudible)...the stereo. Wakes you up, anyway. With that, oh, a funny thing happened to me last night. It was scary, though. I was standing in the ladies\' room. I work two jobs and midnight. I work at night. I was standing in the ladies\' room [all the ways] (ph) - I was standing on the scale yet, and I hear somebody trying to get in the door and I heard a man\'s voice say something and I didn\'t understand him. So ahhh... Because the cleaning lady had said somebody had gotten raped up there or attacked or something. So I was just standing there, you know, couldn\'t move from the scale, because I knew it would go choo, choo, choo, you know. So I was like this, doing "I hope to heck he goes away."Twenty minutes later I guess he had left and the janitor came and he started yelling, "Candy, are you in there," or "Janitor Lady" I guess he was saying; we found this out later. I went, "Candy\'s not here." He goes, "Is that Jane?" Well, there was a cleaning lady named Jane on that floor. Scared the living daylights out of me, because now he\'s there. "He knows my name. Who is he? What\'s he doing," you know? I was so scared. 0:01:22.1 But it was so funny, because when I finally heard the cleaning lady come and I went out, you know, and everything, then I went down to the fourth floor where I work, but this was on the 9th, 10th or 11th floor, something like this. And I went in and I was talking a mile a minute, because I was real nervous, and then my boss came, whom I\'ve been seeing a little bit off and on. I think he\'s just a little bit unhappy with his wife. He loves her, though, so I mean, you know, it\'s just like a side thing he wants and I don\'t want to give it to him. But anyway, I started crying when I saw him. I was fine talking to this other fellow a mile a minute and then I saw him and went, "Seth," and I started to cry. It was so funny because I was so uptight. I\'ve never been like that, I don\'t think, in a long time. It was something like - well, the reason I think I even brought this in is because - well, was it last Saturday? Yeah, last Saturday. My girlfriend came over, one of my two best girlfriends. And we had a party for her. We had like a birthday party. It was real cute because she didn\'t know about it. She went in the washing machine, [did my - my other girlfriend ran and she had this cake out from the refrigerator, opened it up, put the candles on, everything while she was in the washroom, and we poured out the coal bucket and were standing there when she walks out the door. 0:02:29.4But later on we started talking, you know, and part of it was that my other girlfriend had been very hard for a long time and like she couldn\'t get emotional. And it was really beautiful, because this is the first time I ever saw her have like tears in her eyes when she talked about somebody else. And she was talking about this woman, this older woman that she was real close to. And it was so beautiful because like I never saw her do this before. She was never real soft like that. She was always like - I always took it for sophistication, like "Nothing bothers me," that type of thing, but it wasn\'t. It was like a hardness that she had put like a shell around her and she had broken out. And in a way it was like, again, that I was left out, but not left out in that they didn\'t want me to be there, but left out like I saw two girls who had broken through and I hadn\'t, and I realized I hadn\'t gotten there yet. It really kind of bugged me because I said, "Ah shit, I wish I could feel like that." 0:03:21.8 I mean like I can talk about somebody who is beautiful and everything, but this was not my problem was what I\'m saying. Like I can get emotional at times about somebody who is really very nice, or like if I see somebody who has really got a detriment physically and they - like they\'ve overcome an awful lot and then I get - I start to feel like I want to cry and things like this. I mean I can do that, but like that was her problem that she broke through, and I\'ve got another problem that I haven\'t broken through yet. See, like I\'ve always had this sensitivity towards people, but she kind of blocked it out for a long time.That\'s something you have to do?Yeah. See, there\'s only like - they\'ve broken through like - see, she had a different front to break through than I had. I don\'t even know exactly what breakthrough it is that I\'ve got to break through.But just seeing that made you feel that you had a place to go there. 0:04:20.9Yes. Someplace like I haven\'t come yet. You know, and like - this was the way I tied the two things together is that I went into the washroom, and it shocked the heck out of me because like I\'d never thought like this before. I mean in the higher - being really upset I might say something like, "Jesus, I wish I was dead." So then \'m very coldly sitting on the toilet and saying to myself, "Well, if in six months I don\'t find out what the hell is wrong with me, you know... Like I don\'t care about the hurt, but if I know what\'s wrong with me so that I could remake my life," I said, "I\'m going to kill myself." And I just thought of this very, very calmly and coolly and I was thinking different ways that I could do it that wouldn\'t be real bloody, because who wants to be bloody. I\'m being a little dramatic, but not bloody. 0:05:01.7So I said to myself, "Jesus Christ, you know, here I am very, very coldly calculating that well, "It\'s been six months, I\'ve given myself enough time, and I\'m going to kill myself," and that\'s ridiculous. And then you turn around the next week, you know, and you\'re sitting in this situation and you\'re wondering, "Oh, Jesus, what happens if he\'s got a knife, you know."Yeah.You know, like the type of thing... And I put that together myself the other night. Last night when I got home I almost cracked up, because it was so funny like, within a week - not even a week, like four or five days - of the difference. You can say like you don\'t value life or anything, and then the next week, when it really, really comes right down to it, where you could be getting killed, it\'s a little different.Yeah.Oh, it was so funny. But anyway, that was really a nice party, except that, you know, I kind of felt like I wish they wouldn\'t have brought that up then, because I really felt badly afterwards. I mean we had a ball. We all got drunk and everything, you know. They had to go up and...Well, what could they have brought up?But they brought up, you know, like my problem. I didn\'t want them to. I mean like it was her party. And I felt like I kind of cheated her for at least a little while, but she got real emotional and she almost started crying after I was bawling all over the place. The other one was almost crying. This is her birthday party and they\'re bringing up my problems and you know, like everybody is getting all emotional. I didn\'t think it was right. 0:06:15.6It was too much attention to you.I didn\'t - yeah, partly that, and partly I wouldn\'t mind so much attention. It\'s the idea the height of attention. Like who wants you - like here you are, you go, "Happy birthday," you know, boo-hoo-hoo, everybody is bawling. You know, like to me, that\'s not the way to celebrate a birthday, so I felt a little bit bad about that, you know. I felt nice that they both said, you know, "Like we both care and we\'re both here if you need us," but I didn\'t like the idea of taking it on them. We could have brought it up some other time. But anyway, it was a pretty good party, laying around. They all got bombed (chuckling) and then we also get real goofy. 0:06:52.3 But it kind of scares me that the only time I can feel like I\'m really having fun now almost, or that like I don\'t have to escape like to this dream world or whatever to really feel like I\'m happy inside... Like you know, I\'ll run around at work and that and I\'ll be singing and this and that, but it\'s not because I\'m really that happy, it\'s because I\'m so damn bored or whatever. I\'m not satisfied. So what I\'m doing is when I\'m singing I\'m not really like in a dream world or something, but like singing makes me happy, you know. Just the singing itself, like singing out loud and that; it takes me out of the situation and like makes me feel almost like I\'m not there. It\'s not like when I\'m escaping to a dream world where I\'m fabricating a world. It\'s like I\'m there. I know I\'m in the office and I\'m there and I\'m functioning, but I can\'t really explain it. It\'s like singing really has something for me. It\'s kind of like a release for me and I like that, and that\'s why I\'m running around the office singing. And I\'m happy when I\'m singing, and everybody says, "Why are you so happy in our office?" Well, I said to myself, "Shit," you know. "When I\'m working I\'m at unhappy as you are, because I can\'t stand it." But I don\'t know, it\'s just... 0:08:05.9Let me see if I get that. That\'s like a new thing for you. You don\'t have to go off in your head into fantasy. There are other ways that you find to be happy. Is that right?Yeah, this is partly it. This is why I say probably singing would be a good thing for me, because it\'s something I could do for a long time and enjoy it, you know. It\'s not like typing; I can\'t stand it. I\'ve been typing for years and I still can\'t stand it. Or other times that I like it is when I\'m communicating with people, like when people come in and it\'s real nice, you know. Even if it is just to ask a fellow if he wants coffee or what does he want in his coffee or some stupid thing like this. It\'s just, you know, like then I\'m communicating. It\'s like, say, "Oh, my gosh. Here is another human being that I\'ve never met before, and it\'s like a whole new experience," and that really intrigues me. 0:08:49.5But like the regular work drives me crazy, Jesus, blah. But, you know, I guess you have to [add though] (ph) accept it. Like I know those two, like I had the radio on last night, and for this fellow I just type envelopes right now, but I make good money at night, so, you know, why not? I need the extra money. But I can type earphones (ph) like if I\'ve got the radio going or something, it doesn\'t bother me, because like I type with the rhythm and I\'m sort of halfway listening to the song and I can do that and still type without making all sorts of errors. 0:09:25.5But like at my office, I don\'t know. And then there are other things. Like we\'ve got this office manager, and partly I think it\'s me. In fact, I\'m sure it\'s me, because I always did feel like that, you know, like people are picking on me. But like I\'d come in late lots of times, like almost all the time, and I got really mad because I got my raise and everything, but they had like an evaluation, and she had the only derogatory remark of that whole office about me. You know, like I had good on everything else, excellent on the communications with staff and clients, and then like good in everything else, and that was like probably one of the highest ratings around, because most of the girls got good all the way down. 0:10:01.3And I said to myself, you know, like I got my raise, which is an average raise, and I think the only reason I only got average was because of her remarks, saying I\'m always late and I walk around too much. Well, I brought that up with my girlfriend. You know I said - you know, I don\'t walk around all that much unless I\'ve got something to do. But she said, "Yeah, I think maybe you do," because like before she went into therapy she used to do it as like a parading thing, like, you know, "Notice me, notice me, I\'m here, I\'m cute," or whatever. You know, "Notice me."And I said, "Yeah, there are times like when I\'d cut through like the staff room." We had like all sorts of young fellows. Or I\'d go around the side, because like the fellow that I really - like one fellow I kind of dig. I like to try and pass his desk as much as possible. I mean I would have an excuse to get up. It wouldn\'t be like I just parade around with no excuse, but I would notice myself, yeah, I would take certain little routes and that when I was going some place so that these certain people would see me so that I would be able to say, like, you know, "I\'m here." But you know, like I guess I sort of like resented her for doing that. 0:11:08.0For telling you this.For putting it down on the report, you know, like a bad report on me. Whereas actually that was her job, I guess. But now, you know, the thing I didn\'t like either is like the next morning I came in and I was like five minutes late, and I\'m usually like 10 or 15 if I\'m late. And I came up with this one girl who the day before had just said she didn\'t get her bad report because she\'s never late, you know, and like I came up with her five minutes late and then she went right to the wash room. And I know her, like ten more minutes in the wash room before she even went to her desk, which meant she came in a quarter after 2. You know, and I said to myself, "Hey, how come? You know, how come she didn\'t get it and I do?" So one thing that I guess sort of sours me is that now she\'s got a new thing out, being manager, that like all the secretaries have to call in when they come in, so like there can\'t be anything as far as probably just going for one girl or another, which I think they should have done in the first place. If you\'re going to pick on one person, make sure that you know there are other people there or they\'re not there, you know. Of course, I would have done that if I\'m a manager, but I\'m not. But, you know, like I think it\'s a good idea. 0:12:14.0But I really did. I felt like, you know, for a while like, geez, she\'s picking on me, and really, you know, like I rationalize, because I know that what I did was wrong so who cares about the other person? So what, you know. But I don\'t do that. I like to rationalize, like to get myself into it. Like the crowd does this so why can\'t I, you know? Why do you pick on me? And you know, I talked to my girlfriend a little bit. I said, "Well, then, why would she pick me? Like I\'ve never done anything to her." Like I was never mean to her, I was never slanting to her or anything like this, you know, before. As a matter of fact, I was in [hell with her] (ph) when she did that to me. 0:12:55.4 But my girlfriend said, too, she said, "Well, why did you think on these lines, that maybe she saw the little game you used to play with your boss?" You know, like I still do it a little bit, but now I know, so I catch myself and I stop it. But you know, I used to go like this to my boss, I think I told you. "Come on, come on. No, stop. Come on, come on, stop." And you can\'t do that, I guess, with a boss, especially with a Jewish older man type boss, because he will take advantage, and I know he was doing it for a long time. Like he\'d come in and he\'d put his arm around me, all this bull, and he didn\'t care who was there.I\'m having some trouble getting hold of this, because it feels a little to me like you\'re bringing in things to tell me that happen to you or like - I mean it\'s not quite like reporting, but it\'s like bringing things in. But what I\'m wondering is like, you know, what\'s real for you right now, and like what are you feeling now about it?You mean about the whole thing like with the office, what happened? Or are you just meaning...Either that, or just in general. I mean if that\'s what\'s real for you, then that\'s okay. But it sounds a little like you were just telling me what\'s happening in your life this week sort of thing and I don\'t get a feeling what\'s really right now.I don\'t know (inaudible at 0:14:19.7) right now. I don\'t know. I thought sometimes when I start talking about something that\'s happened or that\'s happened to me, I get feelings about it afterwards. You know, like when I talk about it again, I sort of - I either understand why I did something - and then like this may have something to do with my basic problems, you know, that I try to get out. And I guess that\'s the only reason I say it personally, because I just come out, oooo (ph), whatever comes, you know, like I don\'t know what to say. And it\'s very hard for me to say like what I feel right now or whatever. But, see, like if I start talking about something sometimes I get into a feeling of some sort, like a rejection feeling or like everybody\'s picking at me, feeling the world doesn\'t love me feeling, that type of thing that - I don\'t know. 0:15:12.0You know, sometimes like when we had that party for New Year\'s I feel - I\'ve got to feel good, because I realize that I\'ve broken through a little bit; that you know, I realize now how to - like to have fun for me is actually to give rather than just sit back and say, "I hope somebody gives me attention, you know."So here it\'s like you don\'t know exactly what to say so you just let whatever comes into your head hang out.Come out, yeah.And then it\'s like sort of sorting out...What I said and what\'s going on and, you know... Sometimes I think, too, like - I sometimes feel like I\'m railing (ph) from one thing to another and I don\'t understand what has triggered this other stuff. Because like I even thought of what I\'m going to say before I come. It\'s just like I was thinking about last night, because I mean I was thinking about last night from last night to this morning and I\'m thinking, "Jesus, what would happen if I got killed?" 0:16:11.0But otherwise, I don\'t know. Like I don\'t know what to say when I come in so I just let out what I\'ve done or whatever comes to my mind. And I guess the only reason it comes to my mind is like it\'s stuck in my mind, you know, because otherwise it wouldn\'t be important. And I guess whatever it is I just sort of like mull through it; sometimes I do that on the way home. I wonder like why did I say this, you know? Like where did it come out, where did it come from?Yes, that helps me, it gives me a better sense.Okay. Because like otherwise I wouldn\'t know. It\'s very hard for me to explain like how my life is right now or like what I feel, period, about life. It\'s too general, you know, to say like what I think my problem is or whatever; it\'s just too general. The only thing I can do is like say what\'s affected me, you know, and like sometimes maybe because of my feelings about it and my understanding of what\'s wrong. I don\'t know though. It was very funny, but my brother has been in my mind an awful lot lately again. Like last Sunday we had somebody call and then we didn\'t answer the phone because we were hung over from the night before. Then somebody came to the door and they kept ringing the bell and ringing the bell and ringing the bell. And at first we thought it was my girlfriend\'s mother returning something. So it\'s like, oh well, so what, she\'ll leave it with the janitor so we can pick it up when we get up, and there was no note and she always leaves a note. 0:17:46.5So I like put two and two together and figured, well, my brother has done this kind of thing before. Of course, he\'ll come over, but usually he doesn\'t even call. He doesn\'t even go that far to call, he\'ll just come over. But I\'m wondering like why, if I didn\'t care about my brother, why would I even think it might be him? You know, it\'s like I try to deny it a lot of times. It\'s like I really care. But I think, you know, like deep down, like when I said I didn\'t love my mother, and it\'s sort of like it comes back like I love her, but I don\'t know how to exactly. And like I love her, but like I don\'t know what to say to make her feel like she\'s... 0:18:18.8First of all, she\'s got a big thing on. She doesn\'t feel like she\'s a good mother and all this baloney. So like I can talk to her, but then I\'ve got to be very careful. Because like I wasn\'t before, and I think partly it was because I was trying to hurt her. You know, I came up with things like - you know, like "I\'m not a Catholic any more," and I knew right away that would hit right at the roots, because like she was a Catholic-Catholic. And it was like denying like I really cared for her, because it was like pushing her off, because I felt like she rejected me so, "The hell with you, I\'m rejecting you, too." 0:18:52.0And it\'s the same with my brother, but I guess it\'s going to take me even longer. See, first I came to the conclusion like if somebody doesn\'t love you, you can\'t force them to love you, but now I\'ve got to get to the point where not only that, but even though he doesn\'t love me I can still love him, you know. And it\'s very hard for me to do, because I say, "You don\'t like me, I\'m not going to like you, the hell with you," you know. That\'s my usual relationship with people. If somebody says they don\'t like me, I don\'t have to like them, I can cut them off. But when it\'s like a family it\'s a little bit harder to do, you know. Like this is my own brother, so because he doesn\'t love me I can cut him off just like that? You know, it\'s very hard for me to do, because I do care about my brother. Because like another thing, last night I was reading the Times, and I saw this fellow and he was in some prison or something. And I swear to God, it looked just like my brother. And I said, "Wait a minute." And then (inaudible at 0:19:46.6) use my imagination like my brother. I wonder if my mother is - my step mother was lying to me and he\'s really in jail or what am I going to do. All these things ran through my mind. And then I said, "Stop getting so darn emotional," because I knew he was out, I talked to him on the phone, so I knew like he wasn\'t in jail. My brother not, you know, that type. My real brother is not anyway. 0:20:11.1So I said to myself, "Boy, if he\'s in your mind that much there has got to be some feeling or something there, because you don\'t think about people you don\'t care about, you know."What is the feeling?I don\'t know, but like with my brother I feel very hurt mostly. Like every time - like when I went out there at Christmastime and I\'d see this gorgeous stereo. I mean it\'s not like I wanted him to buy me a stereo. But it\'s the idea like he gives this girl who is not his sister, who is not any relationship to him, something that is expensive. A stereo is expensive. He doesn\'t make much more money than I do a month. He makes like - well, what do I make, about six? And plus a little extra, it\'s almost - it\'s like maybe 600 a month and then maybe a little extra typing and like that\'s it.It\'s like you\'re replaced.Yeah, right.Very replaced.And he makes like 900 a month, yeah. So you know what I\'m saying; it\'s proportionate; that like he makes either (ph) in a month or something like this. And you know, like I\'m making, what, about maybe three-fourths of what he\'s making and I couldn\'t afford a stereo for somebody, unless, you know, I really scrimped and saved and really cared, because he\'s got a car, too. 0:21:19.1So not only are you replaced, but it\'s sort of like slapping you in the face with it, because it\'s...Yes, because it\'s such an expensive gift comparatively to what he makes. And then like he gave her a watch for her birthday and all sorts of things, you know, or a clock radio, I don\'t know what sort of birthday... But I mean expensive things he gets her. Not even a card to his sister. I mean like that\'s not... All right, maybe because she\'s a young girl and her parents don\'t make all that much money and he\'d like to get her something special. Even that I can condone, but not to even call me or take me out for a drink or do something, you know, like I\'m his sister.Yeah, like nothing is for you.Nothing for me, you know. And it\'s like I sit there and I think, Jesus Christ, you know, I\'ve got a brother and he doesn\'t even care about me, you know, and you\'re supposed to - you know, I guess then going right back to me. He\'s supposed to care because he\'s my brother, and I guess like you can\'t say that, because just because he\'s my brother doesn\'t mean he\'s supposed to care. 0:22:13.9But that\'s the way it should be, like if you don\'t have that you miss something.Well, you know, I bring stuff for Mary, too, and also for my other step sister, and like they\'re only my foster sisters, you know. And I feel myself I\'ve only got one real brother, and he\'s really my brother. You know, I can say, "This is my brother and he\'s really mine, you know," and I can say this because he is my blood brother. And then I say to myself, "I can say it, but you know, like, big deal, you know." It\'s kind of hard to say like - I think I said this before - I think it\'s kind of hard to say to somebody, you know, like "My brother lives eight blocks from my house and I haven\'t seen him but maybe once since I\'ve moved here and I\'ve been here for eight months," you know, and people say, "What do you mean eight months? You\'ve got your own brother this close," all this bull. 0:23:02.1And I don\'t know, you just - to me it\'s really kind of a bad scene that he\'s like that, that he doesn\'t want me. But you know, again, like if I stop getting emotional about it I could say, well, like he\'s going through a bad time, too. And just talking to him the last time I knew he\'s near a nervous breakdown again, because I mean he\'s almost incoherent. He speaks like two miles a minute, you know, boom, boom, like this, and he never used to do that, you know. And then like if you touch on a touchy subject or something, he\'s, doomgh (ph), you know, like he\'s really - that\'s just like defensive. But he\'s almost like up in a rage, just for like no reason. Like "All right, I disagree with you, so what?" And it kind of bugs me in that way. Of course, it also bugs me that he\'s not open-minded at all either, which really bothers me.So there are things about him you don\'t like, too. 0:24:07.3Yeah. But sometimes - well, I do this with my girlfriend, too, and I know it. Like lots of times I\'ll say things like - see, part of it is like my girlfriend has got - and she admitted it, too, like Saturday. She said, "All right, I guess it\'s hard to live with a girl who\'s got everything," and she does. I mean she\'s got like - any boyfriend she wants, any fellow she meets she wants, she can get; it\'s just like that, you know. And she\'s got like boyfriends that are rich and all sorts of things and they\'re real nice and they\'ve got all sorts of plans and everything else and they take her to all the nicest places and she teaches and she makes all sorts of money and she\'s real smart and she\'s pretty and she\'s got like - plus she\'s nice. You know, she\'s got what every girl would want to have, you know, and she\'s traveled halfway around the world. She\'s going to go all the way around the world next year. It\'s just like the girl who has everything, and then you\'ve got the girl living with her who\'s got nothing, you know. And you\'re sitting there, oh, Jesus Christ, you know. 0:25:06.8 Like it bugs me even more again, because I know I\'ve got the capabilities, at least mentally. I\'m sure I\'m almost as smart as she is, because I think - when I think, when I turn my mind on and really think about it, I can think almost as fast as she can. So I know I\'m probably as smart or almost as smart as she is. So I\'ve got the capabilities of doing like almost everything she\'s done and it really bugs me that I haven\'t done hardly anything yet and she\'s - I know she may be a little older. She says she\'s about five years older than I am, four or five years. You know, and you kind of think, "Gee whiz, you know, four or five years I\'d never get done what you\'ve got done." And it really kind of bothers me, because I can\'t help but compare myself with her. You know, like when you live with somebody. I don\'t know, maybe it\'s not with a normal person. With me, I\'ve always compared myself with somebody else.And that comparing just always leaves you one down. 0:25:54.8Yes, right. Well, I mean when you\'ve got a girl like that and you\'re living with her and people come over... And she shares her friends to a certain extent, but again, like she\'s got that insecurity about her father so she - it\'s like that far, and that\'s as far as you go. Otherwise, you\'re flirting or you\'re doing this and that. And like lots of times I know I\'m not, you know. It\'s just like sometimes I just didn\'t know what to do. I didn\'t know like what the line is for politeness and things like when does it become a fellow is like - not taking advantage, but like getting too spoiled. I mean in the area of like when you come in, take his coat, when you get him a drink, make sure he\'s getting a drink. If he wants something to eat, ask him. You know, like whatever. You know, like I don\'t know how far to go in that area yet, because I just haven\'t been around that much. And so you know, because of that, like things are like you\'re flirting or not flirting with him. I just want to make sure he\'s got a new drink or whatever, you know. 0:26:52.5And so I\'ll come back with something. I remember that one time I did that, I came back with something. She said, "Cuidado." That\'s Spanish for "Careful." And I said, "Ah, you cuidado," you know. Because we were both half stoned by that time, too, you know. And it was like, oh, we had this weird thing going. We\'ve got this friend, and I don\'t know like why she dug him at first, whether I - I drew up (ph) because maybe it\'s just me, you know, because I like to almost cut her down so that, in my eyes, she\'s not quite the far above, you know, so I cut things down that she does. 0:27:33.6It sounds like that\'s the important thing in there; that you really - she has a lot of things that you really want, right?Yeah, right.You really want to be like her.Yeah. And then sometimes I have to sort of check, so I say like, "Well, she\'s not so great. You know, like she\'s got balls, too. She\'s not so great. They\'re just dumb that they don\'t see them or whatever, you know. She\'s selfish, too, you know." And then it doesn\'t make me feel so badly, you know, like because then when I compare myself with her I just say, "Well, yeah, but look, you know, something like - what can I say? She\'s got a lot of self-worth and like - a lot of times she\'ll say like - well, she can be too much of a bitch and I really don\'t like... Sometimes when we\'re out with fellows, like she says she doesn\'t like the way I act towards them, because I try to be smart-mouthed, too, and I\'m not; it\'s just not my nature, because she is very smart-mouthed with a fellow. She calls it witticism; I call it being smart-mouthed. 0:28:30.7You know, to be witty is one thing, but there is a way of handling it. And sometimes it\'s funny and like I laugh and some of the things she does is really cute, but sometimes like she goes overboard to the point where like I don\'t even like to listen to her and I know the fellows get irritated. But like what do you say...On the one hand you can see she has faults, but on the other hand she seems like perfect or something.Or at least an awful lot more perfect than I am. Like that came out Saturday, too. I said, "Not a lot further advanced," or something like this. I said, "A lot better than I am," And it sort of just came out, like I just blurted it out, "Well, like I know you\'re a lot better than I am." Like she was telling me like I haven\'t been at home. I haven\'t been like really that upset very often. Like I can go to work from here. Like once in a while I go to work from here and I won\'t be able to work very much, because like I\'ll be thinking about what happened or whatever, you know, what I said, and like when I realized that my mother would never pay any attention to me or that it\'s like my brother didn\'t love me and things like that, that bothered me a little. 0:29:35.8 But like I could almost turn off and finish the day and then go home and then sit there, like I sit in the wash room or someplace away from her and I just sit and I think, you know, how whatever would come would come, you know, and I\'d just sit by myself. But she says like, well, I could do that at first, but this is why she says it\'s going to take me a long time, because like I don\'t get real upset. That\'s what she said. But see, like, this was the thing I was trying to explain to her. Like I\'m different from her, you know, and I just don\'t like the idea - like I know I\'ve copied her and I still do a little bit, but I don\'t want to anymore, you know. I\'m to the point now where I really just don\'t want to copy her, partly because maybe she\'s been kind of pounding it into me, like a photocopy is never as good as the original and all this. 0:30:22.4But also something for you, like you really don\'t want that.Yeah.(Cross talk)It\'s partially me, because I\'ve always been an independent. I\'ve always been like a loner. Almost all my life I was like a loner. And then I guess partly it\'s because I really get to - finally found somebody like a friend, like I\'d never had before, you know, like I was really kind of pretty close. And like I\'d been through lots of things, like I improved a lot for help and this and that. But like I don\'t feel quite as - like I look back at myself two or three years ago, I think well, all my life I did improve a little bit, because I was really bad off.So it\'s good not to be a loner in that sense, but then you kind of went over the edge.I went over it, right, and it was like not only did I not want to be a loner any more, but I didn\'t like the way I was or who I was or what I was. And so I was trying to take on this, because I thought look what she\'s got, look at all these friends. It probably was a thing with me that I guess I really wanted friends, but I would never go out of my way to like be a friend or whatever you want to call it. Like I would never - I would always expect that people would come to me; it was like I expected that, you know, and I don\'t have to do anything, you come to me. It was a very selfish thing.Yes, so you learned a new way to be. 0:31:41.5Yes, through her, and then what the idea was is then I thought, well, people really dig her because of what she does or what she is or whatever, so like I was trying to be like her. And then I thought, "Well, you know, then people will dig me, too, or people will like me."I think for you in that was that you really wanted that to happen. You wanted to be close to people and you would just find any way you could to make that happen.Right, right. I guess I just didn\'t know; that was the big thing. I just never learned, you know, like how to communicate or whatever, or even to communicate enough of an emotion. I really can\'t explain it, but like it works sometimes even, partly because I don\'t care about the people, really. I don\'t care about that. There\'s not very many - there is like one girl in the whole office that I kind of like; I think she\'s a nice girl and we\'re fairly good friends, but like the rest of the people I couldn\'t care less about. You know, just the heck with you. 0:32:37.9But it\'s like I would come in, and like if I had something to say - partly because Jodie like, does most of the talking in our house - you know, like if I sit down to have a talk with her, ha-ha, I sit down and I listen; that\'s all I do most of the day. And so like if I did something and I wanted to share it with somebody, I just sit and I talk like this, [shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh] (ph), you know, and get it out, because like I hadn\'t talked to anybody.Yes, so much has been bottled upside. 0:33:05.6Right, right, that it was just anybody. Whoever was there, you know, "Sorry, you\'ve got it, you\'ve had it, sit down, I want to talk."So it was like ignoring that they were there, kind of, and just letting everything of yours come out.That\'s what it was, yeah, and it was like a selfish thing, that like I didn\'t let them share, either, like. Even if they started to talk a little bit it would just be like [shh, shh, shh, shh, shh] (ph), and I\'d be talking again, you know. And I guess that came from like a long time ago, too, because like when I was at [White Hairs] (ph), when I was like lots younger, between, what, 9 and 12, I wouldn\'t talk hardly at all. I mean like I\'d say whatever I had to say and I mumbled, I\'ve always mumbled.Yeah. But like maybe it was selfish, but for years you couldn\'t ever do that with anybody and you really needed to do that.Right. And even at school like I didn\'t talk all that much, I don\'t think. I used to talk when like the teacher wasn\'t there, but mostly I was a reader. Like I would sit down and, boy, if I could sneak a novel or something behind a regular school book I\'d do it and I\'d be in there reading and I was always like that. Or I\'d stay up until 2 in the morning and read by the hall light. That\'s why I\'m wearing these. 0:34:17.6 And it was like I really was becoming an introvert, which is not natural for me, because naturally I\'m very extroverted; I love people, you know. And it really I guess has bugged me. It must have really done quite a bit to me to be that way. Now, I don\'t know exactly why I got that way, but I do know that like I was, you know, like really into myself, like a real shell.And then when you began to come out it had to be then you hadn\'t learned ways to be with people.Yes, right.Like putting you into that.Right, you know, and it\'s hard to learn, you know. And it\'s like when I\'m relaxed and - let\'s see, how can I say it? - just me. And sometimes I really can\'t understand it. Like I\'ve always liked the idea of people enjoying my company or whatever, you know. It\'s like, well, you want people to enjoy you, you like to be with people you enjoy, and you also like people to like you and have you around, and you like to say things that they like to hear type of thing. Not so much like I told a big story or something because somebody wanted to hear it, but it\'s like you like them to receive you well, you know, and whatever is important to you. 0:35:36.5 And I find myself like sometimes I\'ll say something that they\'ll just crack up and I can\'t understand what\'s so funny about it, because like I didn\'t think it was funny, but maybe it\'s just the way I said it, you know. And yet, if I try to be funny, or like when I was trying to be smart-mouthed and I thought, "Boy, that\'s clever, ha-ha-ha-ha, you know, boy, did I say something," everybody just kind of looks at me and goes, "Oh well," you know, and you think, "Well, so much for that one. Chalk it up to failure."So it\'s like you would like people to enjoy you and sometimes that just happens when you\'re being yourself.Yeah. But when I\'m like - I\'m like uptight, I guess, because like I get really nervous, and I didn\'t realize how nervous until my girlfriend - like last night she said, "You know, that I was sleeping and you woke me up," because I actually tremble at night sometimes. And I said, "I didn\'t realize I was that nervous. I really didn\'t." And she said, "Honest to God, you just started to tremble. You scared the living daylights out of me." I said, "Oh, well, that\'s happened sometimes." Like not exactly that, but like when I\'m going to sleep at night sometimes, if I\'ve had like a rough day, and especially if I haven\'t exercised, because I usually exercise before I go to bed, you know, and then by that time I\'m not real - you know, it gets almost all the nervousness out of me. But like I\'ll go to relax and all of a sudden the body will just go like that, you know, like a little tremor, but she says I actually tremble, and I said, "Geez, I didn\'t expect that much." 0:37:02.7That\'s a lot of nervousness.That\'s a lot of nervousness is right. And things like - well, she says I do some goofy things, like I talk in my sleep about three nights a week. I said, "Well, did I say? Anything interesting," you know? Like come on, maybe it\'s something to be important.But you were saying like you get really nervous with people and that\'s...Yeah. I guess it\'s like - but most of it, you know, most of it is like because I\'m thinking of me and I\'m thinking about, you know, like how are they going to accept me. Like when I don\'t do that, when I just think like, "Well, here is somebody new, you know, like let\'s explore" or "Here is somebody new, they seem very nice, you know, like let\'s..." You know, that\'s it. And you think like of them or you get interested in what they\'re saying, and then you find yourself not nervous and being yourself. You know, like that\'s how I find myself. And again, this is a little bit new.If you can get this out of your head.Yeah. See, because like always, when I was little or whatever, I can remember things like you had to watch what you were going to say. If you had company, make sure that you don\'t say the wrong thing and, you know, you\'ve got to be... And that\'s the type of thing that I got to, like company or people you don\'t know you\'ve got to be stiff with and you\'ve got to impress them in a very good light. You\'ve got to be very, you know... And I don\'t know, I guess it just sort of grew up with me that, you know, you meet a new person, you\'ve got to give them their (sic) best side or always be, you know... After a while they can get to know whatever you are, but right now they have to think you\'re really something. And I guess I just sort of run over it and now I have to be smart or now I have to be this or now I have to be that, you know. Whatever I think is supposed to be the epitome of what I would like to be or what I think is supposed to be really, you know... 0:38:49.9Yes. It\'s like you have to be a certain way and that holds you in.Right, right, rather just being what I am, you know. I really tried really hard when I was with her. I know a lot of things, like I try to sound smart. I mean not smart-mouthed even, but like smart; like I\'m intelligent, you know. Because this really bugged me, and like I think this has bugged me quite a while and I never realized it. Evidently, maybe like when I was small people made the mistake of saying "You\'re stupid" when you did like a dumb thing or something or what they considered dumb, and so maybe like that grew up with me. And like things like I never thought I was pretty, I really didn\'t, and I think to myself, "God, is that rotten." You know, now I can look in the mirror and say, "Well, I\'ve got a pretty face" and now I can always say, "Well, I\'m fat," and it\'s always almost like an excuse so that I don\'t have to say like I\'m pretty, because it\'s almost like I don\'t want to say I\'m pretty, because I guess maybe then it\'s like saying that you must really have problems because if you\'re pretty people should like you, and like why don\'t people like you? See, it\'s almost like that. See, then I\'ve got an excuse: "Well, fellows don\'t like me because, you know," and then put it on a physical thing, because then you\'ve got a reason why people don\'t like you or why fellows especially don\'t like you. 0:40:13.7 COUNSELOR: So it\'s like you really feel people don\'t like you and then you have to come up with reasons. Yeah, right. I really felt like - like with judo (ph) people. Like we\'ve got - I call them our friends, but they\'re not really my friends, they\'re Jodie\'s friends, you know. And like she says like three or four people have asked her for the house already and that. Well, all right, she\'s been with judo (ph) a lot longer than I have, but some of these girls started with me. And you know, I say to myself, "Well, okay, so I\'ve changed classes. They probably haven\'t seen me as much," which is true, which is maybe part of the reason. Maybe they just don\'t know me well enough. You know, like they might have seen her two or three times a week and then sure, they\'re going to ask her out within three or four weeks. But I just feel as if like it\'s because of something I haven\'t done or something I lack that people just don\'t like me.There\'s something wrong with you.Yeah, because they just don\'t like (cross talk) and I don\'t know why, you know. And it\'s really kind of a sad feeling, like. If I knew what was wrong - see, I\'ve always been this way. Like she\'s even said, you know, she says, "You\'ve come a long way in two years." If I know what\'s wrong I can correct it, or not wrong as per se, but like offensive or whatever you want to call it to like majority of people. I could change it. But if I don\'t know what\'s wrong, you know like I can\'t. It\'s like saying, well, maybe a skunk got me on the way down here and nobody wants to come here, you know, or nobody wants to talk to me. 0:41:35.8 Or I find myself - like one time the phone was dead; like both the instructors, because I had given them some cookies for Christmas... Part of it, too, like I don\'t give enough, Jodie says, so I made them cookies for Christmas and I brought them down.So they were goofing around; I told you about the beer and that. And so for like an hour we were standing around talking and everything and then I just felt like I got kind of scared. I felt like I\'m not being funny enough or I\'m not being, you know... And then I regressed into Jodie\'s type, you know, thing, and it\'s not natural of me. 0:42:08.6So if people don\'t like you then you get really desperate and you have to come up with some way to be [so independent] (ph).Yeah, right, right, or I feel like now my dowdy little personality is completely malnutritions (ph) or whatever you want to call it. Like I run out of material, so let\'s take somebody else\'s material to fill in, or there seems to be a lull. But see, like they really have been really nice to me. Like all right, one of the fellows that I did like likes my one girlfriend and the other fellow likes my other girlfriend, but I don\'t like him anyway.So it sounds like you can\'t quite believe that anybody would like you just for you.For me, yeah, because they don\'t seem to. Well, you know, like I don\'t have the kind of personality like that she has, I just don\'t. Like, well, first of all, she can pull off a lot of these comebacks and then people will laugh at them. Well, what I do is they think of [you as sarcasm] (ph) or they think it\'s dumb. Not dumb, you know, dumb as opposed to being intelligent, but dumb as - not really dumb; dumb is the wrong word. How can I say it? It\'s like it\'s not natural. It\'s like an unnatural thing. And when it\'s unnatural it doesn\'t sound right for me, and I know it, but I still find myself escaping into it, because I just don\'t, like, have the confidence in that what I am is okay. 0:43:30.3 You know, like all right, so if you keep improving over the years... But it\'s okay the way it is right now; it\'s not like something I should be ashamed of, you know. I am ashamed of it. Like I don\'t like being me, you know.There\'s just something about that that isn\'t legitimate or right or...Yeah. I wonder myself, you know, like, and when I try to get down to the basics they say, "Look, we\'re all equal and we\'re all the same in certain areas that - you know, like we\'re all like - we\'re not really what we are here." You know, like the mind isn\'t even the most important thing, the soul is, and that\'s even above the mind. And the soul is - and every person can be - I don\'t know, maybe it can be higher or lower than the other person, but it has nothing to do with how intelligent you are or how - I can\'t explain it. But like rather, what you can do for, like, either other people or how - I can\'t really say good, because that\'s so damn relative, but how much love, like, is in you is actually - and I don\'t mean the emotional type, you know, where you\'re going, "Oh, I love you, I love you, all this bullshit," but like I can\'t really explain it. But like I feel like this - when I really think about it, the soul, to me, is really very important, like this real me, what\'s the real thing down there, and that I can\'t help but like, because like everybody is about the same; you know, like everybody is higher than like a rock or whatever. 0:45:03.7There\'s something inside of you (cross talk).When you get tired of the material, yeah. When you get tired of like the material, when you get down to the material level and then, shit, I have nothing, you know. Or I really can\'t say nothing, because I can look down and say "Like look at these girls who do filing for a living and that\'s all they do all day long," and I think to myself, "Well, they\'re not even going anywhere, they\'re not doing any schooling at night. They go home and watch the boob tube or whatever and that\'s like it." And I think, well, I\'ve come a lot further than they have, and yet, I\'m not where I want to be, which really bugs me.There are two things in that: One is for you, that there are things that you want and ways that you want to be that will feel like fulfilling or something.Yeah.Then there is another one about how you\'re seen in the eyes of the world and the social thing or something that, you know, people won\'t see you having that material thing. 0:46:02.9Yeah, or not even so much outside material things. Like all right, I admit a lot of times I don\'t dress as well as I should, you know, for what I do, and all right, so what, you know. Like sort of what - [that\'s probably] (ph) that\'s all I feel about it. But if I\'m going to the other office, because like I do date the boss once in a while, I make sure I look real good and all this, because he really thinks I\'m sharp, so I think "Okay, great, you know. As long as I keep getting my money I don\'t care what you think."It doesn\'t matter what he thinks.Yeah, this is it, because I don\'t think it and I know it. And this is why I say to myself, "Oh, you\'re really a sharp girl, you\'re really..." But he uses the word "tough" because he\'s from - like where the neighborhood he came from, that means the same thing, good looking or whatever. And I guess part of it is because I say to myself, "Well, I guess he\'s kind of hard up. His wife probably isn\'t giving him what he wants so he\'s got to find somebody." And I do that. I find myself saying, "Well, I\'m the only girl in the office and I don\'t think you\'re so, so lucky" and all this. Not lucky even so much, but like "Don\'t get your hopes up. It\'s not because he really believes that you\'re whatever he\'s saying you are, it\'s because like you\'re the only girl around." Or he met you and compared to what was there I was pretty sharp, but that doesn\'t mean much, because most office girls are not very sharp in any way. They\'re not sharp mentally. They\'re not sharp any way, most of them. They\'re just kind of blah. 0:47:36.4And this is why, you know, like I say, this is part of the reason, too, because I\'m right in-between. I can\'t hang around with these girls, because girls my age and even a couple of years older, act like children to me. I just cannot hang around with them. And yet like the older one, like the office manager, I used to kind of like. I used to sit with her, because she\'s like 40 or close to it. She\'s been around in terms of traveling and that, and I guess she\'s going to school now at night, too, and things like this. So like I could kind of talk to her at least, you know, like almost on an even keel. You know, it\'s kind of goosed (ph) me up and it\'s like I don\'t know where I am, you know. 0:48:16.3Like my girlfriend is only a few years older than I am, and yet, she\'s got a mind like a 55-year-old in terms of like living and all of the things she\'s done. And then I get to the point where like I go to the office and then these people are not really - I can\'t say beneath me, because like, you know, that\'s not right. Like I say she\'s above me, but I don\'t feel like these people are beneath me. It\'s just like there\'s nobody there for me.Yes, no one to match with you.Right, like nobody that I can even have some kind of a conversation with. You know, like emotionally, especially, they\'re really children. It is things like, "Oh, I\'ve got to go to the dance." You know, like I don\'t know, they\'re just like kids. And some of these kids are like - like this one girl had like four years of college and everything, she\'s very smart, and in turn, like I went to this party and she comes out with some stupid statement like, "Liquor makes me very passionate." I mean - I went ahhh (ph0, you know. You don\'t say something like that unless you\'re - like with their office party, people there from your office. First of all, if you want an affair and you want to tell us all, like, signal is go, fine, you know, but don\'t do that in front of like everybody you work with. You\'ve got to face them. I mean any ounce up here is going to tell you you don\'t do that, and it\'s like there is no sense, and that\'s weird. 0:49:43.3You know, I just thought of something; this is funny. I notice why sometimes I\'m talking and I look at you and I wonder why, why is it like - it\'s almost like, again, like I\'m trying to prove - sometimes I feel this way. Sometimes I feel like what I\'m doing is like - I\'m saying what I feel, but I\'m trying to put it in the way that I hope the smartest in people. Even in your eyes, like I shouldn\'t have to do that. But like anybody it\'s like - it\'s like anybody who I think is above me mentally or whatever, I try to make it look like "Really, I\'m not dumb. I\'m not stupid. Please don\'t think I\'m stupid, you know."Yes, I had that feeling, that you were doing something...Yes, and I just realized that. You know, like how am I doing? All I\'m asking for his approval. Did I say that right? You know, and that\'s what just came across my mind, that I do that, like, with people. 0:50:32.6Right. You want to know if I think that that was smart or good or...Yes, or like, oh God, was that dumb, you know. Like "Please don\'t, no, don\'t do that," you know. And it\'s just like I\'m scared.Yes.It\'s like - and I shouldn\'t be scared. This is stupid, but I...You expect that.Yeah.You expect me to think that you\'re dumb.Yeah, right, "I guess that\'s what it is, because I really don\'t have the confidence to say, like, you know, "I\'m not dumb." You know, that\'s really strange; I didn\'t realize that. But I must have really had like a conflict about that for a long time, because it couldn\'t just be like in the last two years that I really felt stupid, because I don\'t know why I would. The people I work with, nine-tenths of them, haven\'t had any college or anything else, and like they don\'t think half as clearly as I do, nine-tenths of them. Like there is one girl in the office, she was smart. 0:51:25.1But that\'s not what\'s important to something. It\'s like a feeling that sticks.Yeah, that\'s what it is. Like I really feel - I should feel ignorant, because I am in lots of ways, this is fine, but I don\'t feel ignorant, I feel stupid, and that I don\'t like. Like if I won\'t catch something right away, I think, "Oh boy, better not let anybody know that because they\'re going to think I\'m dumb," you know. And it\'s really an important thing to me that I don\'t feel stupid, or that I do feel stupid and I don\'t want to.I don\'t feel like you\'re stupid.Yeah, but that doesn\'t help me any. 0:52:03.3I know that doesn\'t help, but that\'s...My girlfriend will say that, too. Sometimes she\'ll say - like she\'ll come out with things like, all right, now I realize this type of thing like when - when you really have an inferiority complex about it, if somebody says something, especially if it\'s something you care about or something you trust or somebody like you know is this far and you\'re here, you know, like she said something to me like - this remark stuck in my mind that she said, "Well, for above-average intelligence you certainly don\'t act it." And I - uhhhh (ph). And I could feel like inside on my - like something in me just going shooooo (ph).right, you wilted.Yeah, right. And yet like when we were having this talk she said like, "You don\'t have to bow to this guy," and I realized I had. Like my boss, like it was like he paid attention to me, so he must have seen something there. But it bugs me like when he\'ll say something like that, too. Like he\'ll say something about - he was on the phone and he said something about my mind. He said, "Oh, should I call it that." And you know, it was like I constantly found myself defending. "Look," I said, "just because I don\'t know anything about this I don\'t want to tackle this bookkeeping," because I was kind of nave in this way; like he was trying to set me up. He knew I couldn\'t do bookkeeping, but he knew if I did take this job - this other girl was setting the books up - but if I did take this job I\'d have to be in late with him, asking him about it, and then he\'d have the perfect setup, or he could say, "Well, look what I did for you, now you do something for me," you know. And he was setting me up for, you know - using me. And again, I guess I felt kind of dumb - not nave, but dumb, that I didn\'t realize that this dodo, that\'s what he was doing, he was setting me up, you know. 0:53:56.1 And I guess, see, in a way that kind of crushed me, too, because again, it was like saying - because she even said this. She was trying to solve my feelings by saying, "Well, he would have done that to anybody," you know. But the way I took it was like, "Shit, here\'s another one that wouldn\'t care less." I could be Jane, I could be Jane, I could be somebody else, and all he wanted was a body, anybody\'s body. Anybody, he didn\'t care. So it was like saying, you know, I\'m not anybody important to anybody, you know. It\'s like I\'m just sort of an extra; that just somebody takes a long when they want to, and that\'s just the way I\'ve always felt. 0:54:40.1Yeah, nobody really cares about you.(Crying from 0:54:43.7 to 58:21.7)(Inaudible at 0:58:20.8) to cry because you were by yourself for a long time and you never really had anybody who could care for you, just you.All I can think of is say (ph) I don\'t want to go. I want my mama.Right. You should have had her. You should have. You were a little girl and you needed somebody. You really needed somebody and she wasn\'t there. 0:59:14.0It\'s so like she went away and she would...Yes. How could you make it all by yourself? You need somebody to take care of you.Every time I really wanted her she wasn\'t there. I remember crying for her one night and I was about 15 or 16. My step mother says, "Oh, you\'re nuts. What are you crying for? Do you want me?" And I says, "No, I want my mother," and she thought I was crazy. She says, "Stop being a (inaudible at 1:00:08.5) child."But you needed your mother. She left you all alone and she sent you off to other people\'s houses. Is that what a mother is supposed to do?She couldn\'t help it but I still wanted her.Of course. You were so alone, all by yourself. 1:01:22.0I was always crying alone, too. We were over at wagers (ph) sometimes and I didn\'t even know why but I cried. He always made fun of my crying.All by yourself. Such a long time of being alone.That\'s why I don\'t think I ever wanted anybody close to me. (Crying)(Inaudible at 1:02:08.0) I says, "Don\'t leave me."Yeah, they go away, too.I says, "What are we going to do this summer?" They\'d just both leave me and I\'d do anything to myself, but it\'s time for other friends and it\'s time for this and this time we\'ll be able to have friends, but I knew I still live (ph) empty (inaudible at 1:02:33.2). I knew I couldn\'t keep on hearing it. It\'s silly and it\'s selfish, but they cared, they\'re the only ones that do, and my brother doesn\'t love me.Yeah.I don\'t even know whether my mother does. And my grandfather got so old (inaudible at 1:03:04.1) me. I remember that. I think he really loved me, but he died and I couldn\'t even go to see him; they wouldn\'t let me. They said he\'s got this big bandage on his head so you can\'t go see Grandpa. They did see Grandpa, but I couldn\'t see him and he died. 1:03:42.1Like you run away from your fears.(Crying) Really was never afraid of me, either. Either that or that table (inaudible at 1:03:54.9) he might still be alive (crying). He was so good.You lost him, too.(Crying from 1:04:23.6 to 1:06:49.3)Like that shouldn\'t have happened to you. You shouldn\'t have had to be alone like that. You have to carry all that with you.I haven\'t even thought about my grandfather for a long time.So it\'s important to you.You know what I felt like? My brother was the one, too, that kept me from him, because I remember she told me, my dad didn\'t. She told me Grandpa was in the hospital and she didn\'t think he was going to live. So I remember I think I went and cried. I said, "I want to see Grandpa."And she wouldn\'t let you go. It was really important to you and she wouldn\'t let you go. 1:08:00.4I used to (inaudible at 1:08:10.0) amusement park and we used to go there and have so much fun. I never got treats at our (inaudible), so I - there was an ice cream parlor downstairs. Every day he\'d give us a dime and (inaudible at 1:08:25.3). Really the happy time I remember was my brother when I was there. He got the bubble gum all over his face and he laughed and laughed.Good times. You had people and people who cared about you and people who you had fun with.And Grandpa really loved me. I really think he loved me.But he died. 1:09:16.5(Crying) (Inaudible).You really needed him and you lost him.(Crying from 1:10:00.8 to 1:11:01.1). I remember when we went to my grandpa\'s and he\'d say, "[I guess I\'ll tell you] (ph). We could just push two chairs together and you can sleep like that." We used to laugh.That was really happy.(Crying from 1:11:21.9 to 1:11:39.9). I remember, too, that he\'d get a potty chair just for me, because he didn\'t want me walking out of the hall to go to the wash room and he didn\'t have one in his apartment. He didn\'t want me to go out there at night because he would wait (ph) for me, so he got that just for me.Just for you.(Crying).You really needed that and you really needed someone to care about you and be special. 1:12:36.9(Crying from 1:12:32.4 to 1:15:59.0).Hard thing.(Inaudible at 1:16:08.2). Then I remember when my father\'s brother died, and I think he was at the wake and like he didn\'t seem to feel anything. And I was crying and I just kind of felt like he didn\'t love Grandpa either, because I don\'t remember him going with us. My mother, my brother and me would go.Someone who was so important to you and he didn\'t care. 1:17:10.5And my daddy didn\'t care about my grandpa. Why did he have to die? He seemed to love me when my daddy didn\'t and I don\'t know why.He loved you and he went away.But I always thought my grandpa went away only because he had to and it was his time to go. 1:18:07.6He left and left you all alone.But I don\'t think I ever felt like he left because he wanted to.Because he really did care about you.I know he really loved me.And he really wanted to stay with you, take care of you.Because I can remember my father saying that he was spoiling us, and I don\'t know what he said back, but I know it\'s something like he loved us and loved me. And he was the one - I didn\'t even care if he loved Ed, too, because I knew he loved me.Yeah, and that was really important. Mommy and daddy didn\'t care. 1:19:06.3.I don\'t understand why he\'d care and they didn\'t. 1:20:22.4And people who were supposed to care about you just didn\'t.I guess this way they might be able to care about me now, sort of like the payback, because I don\'t feel like anybody else did. But you\'re my brother so you\'ve got to love me. You know, it\'s always like maybe because partly because of what he did when I felt like my mom did. Maybe that\'s why I feel like no one can love me or like me for me, because I feel like I must have done something, you know. Like people don\'t just not love you, because you naturally love human beings, unless there\'s some kind of like a monster; and like maybe I guess that\'s the way I always felt, like there was something wrong, because why would everybody go away? 1:21:22.3Yeah, even your mom and dad.This whole lifetime I realize my mom was sick and I guess that\'s why I never really - you know, I felt her because she was gone, but I felt like something like with my grandpa; that like she couldn\'t help it, she couldn\'t be there. Because she used to tell me she\'d pray for me and she\'d always think about me and everything. But you know, like I really didn\'t blame her until I found out there are lots of sicknesses in head. And the first thing I thought of is that I must have done something, because she didn\'t love me. She didn\'t want me there. She didn\'t want to take care of me. 1:22:07.2There must have been something wrong, something about you, something terrible that makes people go away, something you\'re not good enough for them to say.I guess this is why, with fellows, I was so jealous, too, because like if they\'d be flirting with another girl it would be like say like, well, whatever it is in you that you\'re lacking with it, I owe (ph) like, or whatever this girl\'s got and you don\'t have it, and I guess that\'s why I felt so jealous. Because like, you know, I felt like there\'s something there that just keeps people from me. You know, like - I mean like dumb people. Even if I were real dumb - I know I\'m not real dumb, but like if I was real dumb, like people love dumb people, too, you know. Like you don\'t have to always be saying something that\'s real smart or like - like I\'ve been to Europe or I\'ve been here or, you know, like there\'s lots of people that are just nice, and you know, like I feel like that I must not even be nice because nobody wants me. 1:23:38.6Nothing about you is right. Nobody wants you.And you know, like why? What could a 7-year-old do that was so awful that her parents wouldn\'t love her? You know, like I was never really all that bad. You know, like I wasn\'t even that old yet and I was outside playing all day long or in the school, and I wasn\'t even that bad in school; I had average marks. I didn\'t try, but I had average marks. I never had - like call me to the principal or anything. Like, you know, why didn\'t they love me? Why was I so awful, you know, like - and I\'d just think (ph) "Why, what did I do? Why doesn\'t my mother love me?" 1:24:30.6How could you understand that? You were just a little girl trying to make sense of it. It didn\'t make any sense, and the only way you could understand that was by saying that you did something wrong.Then she said, "Well, I don\'t want you to be sent to any crummy place, I want you to go to Springfield because that\'s where I was. And she told me about what it was those nuns did to her when she was in that nice place. She broke a dish or something, but the nun didn\'t like her and beat her until she was black and blue, and that\'s a nice place and she wanted to send me, you know. And I don\'t know if I even realized it until after I was there, and I kept thinking to myself, this is the nice place? 1:25:30.2 And like in-between they put me into a foster home for a month-and-a-half and it was like just a transitional one; they didn\'t keep people there for very long, and I think I really loved them. They just - you know, like they just sort of opened their hearts and they\'d let you play and they were good to us, both of them, like anybody who was there, and like we just had fun and we were there like a month-and-a-half. 1:26:01.3And then you had to leave.And then I had to leave again, and it was just like - I don\'t know. I felt like, again, I did something wrong, you know."Man," you\'re thinking, "nobody likes me this time either and they\'re sending me away."Yeah, and that\'s just the way it was. It was like, you know, "You\'re shipping me up. Either you leave or I go," you know. And it\'s just like I know like relationships of any kind can\'t be like that. Like people are going to die or people are going to, you know, move or people are going to do whatever they\'re going to do. Or like - here I was, I said to myself, "I\'m so stupid, you know, sometimes," because like I don\'t want people to stay around me all the time. Like I\'ll have people I\'ll think I\'ll like as friends and then I\'ll either get to know them or they\'ll change or I\'ll change and they haven\'t changed or, you know, and like I just leave them and I go onto somebody else. It\'s like it doesn\'t bother me to do that to them, and like it doesn\'t bother them a great deal. I mean, so what? So they find other friends that are either, you know, like doing what they\'re interested in or whatever, you know. And yet, like, with me it\'s kind of silly. It\'s like I\'m grasping for something that like won\'t leave, because like how can I say that I did something wrong because my girlfriends are going away, you know? And yet, like I guess it was the same feeling that welled up. It was just like a feeling, like a feeling, like they\'re leaving, what am I going to do? It was like a panic almost, too. 1:27:24.9They\'re going to go away.Yeah, and it\'s like...And I did something wrong.Yes, I think that\'s what really was down the basic of it, because like that\'s what really - I felt like my mother. I felt like I did something wrong because my mother doesn\'t love me, you know. And like I felt like - like with my grandpa; I couldn\'t even go to him, and I felt like I should be there, you know. It\'s like Grandpa loved me. Okay, so Grandpa\'s dying, he\'s leaving and he doesn\'t want to leave but he has to, and they wouldn\'t even let me say goodbye to him. (Crying) I couldn\'t even tell him I loved him, you know, and then...You cared about each other and you couldn\'t even say goodbye to him.I knew he wanted to see me. I knew he did, I could just feel it, and they wouldn\'t let me see him and say goodbye to him. I remember asking my mommy "Please, Mommy, please, I just want to see him one more time, Mommy, please," and she wouldn\'t let me. She kept saying, "You\'re too young and he\'s got this bandage and he looks awful" and I said, "I don\'t care. I don\'t care. I want to see him." You know, I think right now [I say} (ph) she was trying to spare my feelings and she wanted me to remember him the way he looked. I don\'t even remember his face. I didn\'t care about his looks. He was a man, what he was.And she kept you away from him. 1:29:06.9I couldn\'t talk to... I really - I just wanted to say goodbye and I love you. That\'s all I wanted to say to my grandpa. I knew he was going to die; I knew what that was already.She kept you away.Never realized how much that hurt me, that she wouldn\'t let me see him.She did a lot of things. She hurt you a lot.What hurts more is I know she didn\'t do it purposely. You know, it\'s just like she didn\'t know. She didn\'t know how I felt, and like maybe I just couldn\'t tell her. You know, like maybe what I said was like maybe a stubborn brat or something like "I wanna, I wanna, I wanna," and she just thought it was like something else that I wanna, wanna, wanted, and it wasn\'t like the way I really felt.You couldn\'t get it out. You couldn\'t tell her.I did remember telling her I wanted to see Grandpa, because I don\'t even know if I even told her I wanted to say goodbye to him. But I do know I said, "I want to see Grandpa, I want to see Grandpa," and she wouldn\'t let me see him. You know, like all right, she thinks it is kind of a spoiled kid talking, but that was a kid who wanted her Grandpa.And she didn\'t see that. She couldn\'t see that. She couldn\'t see what you really wanted. 1:31:04.1Then like I know she\'s insecure, too, and like I know I probably got part of that from her, too, because like I remember her saying like that\'s one of the reasons she didn\'t see - I felt kind of bad, too, because like I felt like I needed a mother. Even if it wasn\'t my own mother, I needed a mother. And like I felt like she didn\'t want me in a foster home right away. I don\'t know if she told me this or what. Like she\'d say, like, when I finally did get into foster home, like, "You\'re going to love her more than me," or "Do you love her more than me," or something like this. It was like - I guess even then I thought, well, maybe that\'s why I had to spend a year-and-a-half in that damn Springfield, because like my mother was afraid that if she put me into a home where I had at least somebody there who was a woman and there\'s somebody there who was a man who could, you know, like be something like a mother and father, like she didn\'t want it, because she was afraid that - like she was afraid that I would go away. So she really didn\'t care about me, but it was like the same sick type of love that I had. It was like a possessive love, and like it can\'t be that way, and especially with a kid. 1:32:23.3That way you didn\'t get anything.Yeah. And then like I felt kind of drawn to her, because she was kind of like my mother, Mrs. Foley, but I don\'t know what happened. I really just don\'t know. Like all of a sudden like I just turned away from her, more or less. It was like - I can\'t really explain it. I don\'t know whether it was like one time she got mad at me and she said she hated me or what it was. You know, like it was just something that I had done as a mistake and then it just sort of built and built and built. Because at first, I did fine there; it was no problem the first six months or so, absolutely nothing, and then all of a sudden I just don\'t know what happened. I don\'t know whether I didn\'t feel like she loved me as much as maybe her sons or something or I was jealous of my brother or something, or what it was. Maybe it\'s because like my brother was more of a favorite than I was and at home I was the favorite or something. I don\'t know even what it was that started me on it, but I started becoming such an introvert for so long. 1:33:30.1And then like at the other place I was like that, too. Like my one foster sister said I was so selfish. She said, "You\'re so self-centered." That\'s all she cares about is her. And like I realized that. I would tell her like, "Don\'t go upstairs, this is - you\'re a fool," which she was really, because she\'d do like all sorts of things for these girls, and they\'d turn around and talk behind her back like she was some... Well, she played around. She was a young girl. From the time she was 19, I guess she was pregnant, and five minutes after she had the first one she had the second one. I mean she was mixed up, really mixed up emotionally. It was like, you know, I got a guy who came along, choo (ph), you know. "I love you even." It wasn\'t just sex, but it was like "I love you, I really love you. I just met you; I love you," you know, because she had an insecurity about her father, too. 1:34:13.7But you know, like in a way she sees a lot, and I realize that that\'s the way I was. Because like it was like I\'m not going to do this, because as soon as I do something for them all they\'re going to do is turn around and they\'re going to knife me in the back and like hell with them. I\'m not going to let them knife me in the back. I\'m not going to do... This is the way I got after a while. First it was, again, I left myself open for them or I tried to, and it was like I\'d like to talk to - not to my step mother, but like her daughter was like maybe 38 or something when I came to her and I was like 13. And I\'m just going into being a teenager, so I started to talk about things to her, about my boyfriends and the whole bit, and I find out when I\'m like 16 or 17 like everything I\'ve said has gone back. I was out there a couple of times; they were talking about Yvonne (ph), just after she had fixed their hair. She used to do everything for those girls, you know, and they\'d turn around and they\'d talk bad about her. You know, I said to myself, "Is this the way somebody is supposed to be who really cares?" You know, like that\'s not caring about somebody. You can\'t be that way. You can\'t be nicey-nice (ph) in front of them and want them to do things for you and then turn around after they\'ve done them, you know, and like knife them in the back. 1:35:28.3And then you know like, Jesus, I used to go to the store for them all the time and all this other... I said to myself like "I\'m not going to let them do that to me. I won\'t let them do that to me. I won\'t be hurt like that. You know, like they want to talk about me, the hell with them. Good, but they\'re not going to get anything from me."And that\'s the only way you had. You had all that hurt inside you and then you had to protect yourself.Yeah. That happened when I\'d get somebody who I could semi-trust with - like I didn\'t know I had all these hang-ups like with, you know, changing around from here to there. I didn\'t think it bothered me, and I never thought about my grandfather, I really didn\'t. It\'s just like pushed down; I just didn\'t want to think about it, because he was gone.Of course it bothered you; it was a lot. You were just really little, a little girl. You didn\'t have anybody to care about it.And he was like the only one. Like I mean I shouldn\'t say "never did." Like my mother showed me a picture of when we were at the beach. And I like said, "Oh, that was us." And I said, "Oh, is that North Dakota with Grandpa?" You know, I guess the first thing that came to my mind. But like it didn\'t really bother me, because like I guess partly because the only thing I remember right then was like the basic - like there was a happy time, and so like that was it; like I didn\'t go deep enough, because I didn\'t want to. I didn\'t want to say, like, you know, "I love my grandpa," and, you know, you wouldn\'t - again, she wouldn\'t let me go to him. And I think - I don\'t know. Maybe when I was having that daydream it wasn\'t Daddy I was running to, it might have been Grandpa. 1:36:54.3You needed somebody, you know? You really needed somebody.And he was there. And I always felt like he was - I guess I felt like he was there. Like we only saw him every year or something. We\'d go up there for two weeks or a week and we\'d go to see him, but he was just so, so good, you know? And it was just like what an image. Like who could even live up to him? I don\'t think my dad even lived up to the image I had of my grandfather. I don\'t know whether he really was that great, but like to me he was God, you know. 1:37:24.7Yeah, right.It was always grandpa this - I guess. I don\'t know, I feel like it was. I know my mother says I really thought a lot of my grandpa and that I really loved him a lot. She could tell. Like we were up there, we have fun and everything, but I don\'t know. It\'s just like when I got older it got so hard to show any kind of affection to anybody or any kind of real emotion or to feel it. You know, like I feel it coming up, and I think part of my problem, I think I actually push people away. It\'s like I don\'t want you to get close to me because I know you\'re going to leave me, and if I get to like you then you\'re going to hurt me and I don\'t want you to hurt me, you know. And it\'s like I\'m really afraid. I\'m afraid to let go.Because when I let go - when we had that party I had a riot. You know, like (inaudible at 1:38:08.7) people and everything. Like one of the fellows had just met me. A friend of one of the instructors came up and grabbed me from the back of the - said, "Are you cute" or "Are you a doll" or something like this, and you know, it\'s just like, what, you know? Go away. 1:38:21.5Yeah. Of course you\'re afraid to let go. There are too many years of hurt in there.See, but that\'s it. It\'s really hard. It was actually hard. I had to sit myself down for about three days before and prepare myself. Now look, this is what you\'re going to do. I don\'t think I could have done it at that party otherwise. It took me like three days to convince myself that now you\'re going to just think about other people. You\'re not going to care about yourself. Just forget about yourself. Think about them, make sure that they\'re happy, and then just make sure everybody is dancing and nobody\'s left out, see.And don\'t worry so much about people going away.Yeah, and make sure... But see, the funny thing was is I sort of replaced it with a positive attitude, like say like "Don\'t worry about it," you know. "Take the initiative yourself. You see somebody sitting down and they don\'t have a drink or they\'re not dancing or whatever, you get them up and get them dancing. You do it. Don\'t be sitting back and say \'nobody wants me,\' you know, like yet or whatever." And I found I really had fun. I could say at that party I really had fun. 1:39:18.1But like it was like it was very hard to do and it shouldn\'t be hard to do. I mean that\'s silly. Why should it be hard to give? But it\'s hard for me, because I\'m afraid that somebody is going to turn around and just walk away and say, "Lookey-lookey. You gave me all this. Now I\'m going to take it and I\'m going to walk away, you know." Or I feel like...Well, you had good reason for that, but it\'s over now.Yeah, see, that\'s the thing. The thing is to get over that, to say that, you know, like "All right, so that\'s the way it was, but it\'s not like that any more," you know. Like "There are people in the world that do love you."Maybe you can open up and really trust people.Yeah, but it\'s hard.When are you going to begin to do that?It\'s hard to say, because then - see, but then there\'s like guys - my life right now. You know, like I don\'t know about Seth. Like Seth\'s got a problem with his wife and I\'m getting him to talk about it, like I tried to tell him, "Look, Seth, first of all, I like this other guy in the office; he\'s real nice. Will.Listen, it\'s after 10:30. Do you have to go?Well, I don\'t know. Do you have to go?I can stay with this for a while yet, if you want.Okay. I\'d like to work it wait (ph). I just feel like, oh, the hell with it, but I don\'t know. I just - I meet people like Maurie that in - and that\'s my boss, and he - I don\'t know. He\'s just - I used to think he was so nice because like he paid attention to me and everything, and it was like I think the attention that I wanted from my father, because he was an older man and he used to... You know, when he first started out it was things like he just touched my shoulder or he held my hand and he took my hand and he held it, and it was just so warm and nice, you know. 1:41:13.0But like I was saying come on for that reason, not, I don\'t think, because I wanted to go to bed with him or anything like that. I thought at first this was, what? Because I figured, well, this is the normal thing; you know, like young girls usually like older men. Not quite that much older, but usually older men, and it\'s because of sexual attraction. But it wasn\'t really a sexual attraction; it was like maybe for an older man who is like a father. And I guess I just never - like my boss before that would never touch me at all, I mean never. He brushed my hand one time and you know, he\'s "Oh, pardon me," you know, and I think I really wanted him to, because like he was very sophisticated and he looked like Robert Redford. You know, he\'s really good looking; he\'s about maybe 47, 48, with the whole bit, you know.For all those things that happened to you left you needing someone to protect you and being into that rather than really seeing the person for what he was with you.Yeah, right. It was like making a world that I wanted to be there. You know, it was like saying, "Now this is this and I\'m glad," you know, and then not really looking and seeing. 1:42:19.5Because like when I see now... The other day he made a comment. You know, he saw me and he was - he tried to put his hand like this, and I looked at him like that and tried to push his hand away, and he kind of looked like he didn\'t know what was going on, because like "Are you starting this now, are you just breaking it away? Forget it, I don\'t need you and I don\'t want you." I mean I just looked. Finally I just sat myself down and I said, "Now you will look at him and that\'s it, and I want you to see him the way he really is," and I saw everything he said was selfish, selfish, selfish. All he cared about was him, and I realized it. And he said something about it, heck, he was going to say something, was something like a joke, something about people in the office. He said, "You know there\'s only one person in the office I care about," and he looks at me, and he expected me to smile and was going to say himself, but I fooled him. I said, "You, and I know it." And he just went... "Well, now, if you want a ride home tonight..." Because I was working at the other place. He said, "If you want a ride home tonight, just call me," and I didn\'t call him. 1:43:11.7But you had been wanting him only because you needed someone to protect you.Yeah, partly that, and I needed something that was like - yeah, partly that. It was like a projection. Because he said like he was the one that saved me from being fired. I think he\'s full of bull, too, but like I believed him. I wanted to believe him, see. Logically I\'m a good secretary. I\'m not a great secretary, but I\'m a good secretary. And you know, I\'ve got a good working rapport with people, and like that\'s something that most secretaries don\'t have. Like every client that comes in compliments them on me, not because, you know - not because of looks or anything like that, but because I know how to handle people, you know, and they like that. 1:43:51.4But you know, like I said, "Oh my God, Maurie, your name is the second to the least and I should have been the one to go, you know, and my girlfriend says, "Don\'t be such a baloney. Don\'t baloney yourself like that," because she knows Jewish men. She says, "That\'s all he wanted. He wanted to set you up and then take advantage of you." And again, like I said, this made me feel badly, because like I felt like he would have done that to any girl. Any young girl he had working for him he would have taken advantage of, and he just kind of bugged me. Because like that\'s just putting me in a category like with you and a hundred thousand other people, you know. Like if it was something like I was a great challenge even to him, because I was different or I was something, whatever, that he saw something in me that like I was a challenge, but I don\'t think it is. The only reason I\'m a challenge is because I say no. 1:44:41.7 You know, if I would have said yes, you know, he would have done whatever he wanted to do. And it just kind of bugged me, because then again I felt like - it\'s just like I\'m one of the crowd and like who the heck cares, you know? And it\'s just an awful feeling to feel like - you know, I was like - I find myself singing that song, Ticky Tacky People, an awful lot, and it\'s like I really don\'t want to be one. I don\'t want to be like everybody else, I want to be me; that somebody or some people might say, like, she\'s different. You know, she\'s nice, but she\'s - I don\'t care if they say I\'m different or I\'m crazy or I\'m goofy or whatever, but like I don\'t want to be like what they call Josephine Average. You know, like everything is exactly - yes, everything is exactly the same as everybody else. Like I don\'t want that, and maybe it\'s because I want to be special to a couple of people or one person, too, and I feel like if you\'re Josephine Average and you do everything the same as everybody else and you don\'t - and that\'s it, like who are you going to be special to? 1:45:51.6Yes. There are two things: You want to be special for the people who notice you, and you also want that for you.Yes, I think that\'s true. I want to be able to say something like - I say to myself, "Who\'s out there?" I don\'t know who she is. She\'s some typical - well, I shouldn\'t say typical, no. Just from my background I\'m not really what you call typical, but you know, like maybe starting out lower, middle class and maybe ending up middle class. Wow. Like, boy, I really went places, didn\'t I? And I just don\'t feel like I\'ve done anything. I know it\'s because like, see, I like to get too much at once, partly. 1:46:34.1Um-hmm.It\'s just like, see, I feel maybe because I felt like I never had anything at all. Like I just felt like nobody cared, nobody wanted me...And so you have to really push yourself now.Yeah. And now I have to do all this myself because like nobody cares. So the only way to do it... And then I say to myself, you know, sometimes they\'re (ph) so stupid, because if you start caring more about other people, like our drill instructor is getting a friend of his own the apartments in Toyko. They\'re going to get an apartment for my girlfriend when they go there. And you know, like it is things like if you\'re more concerned with other people, like lots of times it makes your life easier, because they help you out. But see, I\'m always afraid that they\'re not going to do it, because like I\'ve done that before. I\'ve been real nice and what happens? Choom (ph), somebody turns around and just stabs you in the back, and so what do you do, you know? You don\'t know, like, how far to go or what to do.Yeah. I think we\'d better stop. 1:47:26.2Me, too, what\'s left of me. Better try to get to the train and get back to work. Now I understand what my girlfriend means, anyway. Thank you.Okay.[She didn\'t even] (ph) fogged off my glasses. I\'ll see you next week.Okay. 1:48:27.8', "Okay, so how you doing?Uh, the same.The same?Yeah, and I just, yknow, keep getting more put on me. I, I know it, it sounds crazy, but it's like I go out of my way, like I feel like a prisoner in my own home. I love to go out in my garden in the backyard.Right. Right.A, a woman moved in last year with this little Chihuahua. She barks I mean constantly. I have to wait and keep looking out to see, constantly. It's like I remember last year my head was going to explode. I had to come in and lay down I had such a headache. So, it's like saying it to her doesn't even like, like she escapes the yard. She's so little and I put bricks, like stones, the red bricks around so, last year 'cause [NAME OTHER] escaped the yard.Um-hum.So, I'm like trying to garden and trying to get her. Yet, [NAME OTHER] I'm going to have to talk to her 'cause I mean I love to garden in the back. That's my relaxation. I'm going, and it's like you have to approach it in a friendly way, and it's like, yknowIs the dog out all the time or?It seems like a lot, even if I'm in my kitchen and my window isn't open, they got super, supersonic hearing. I'll, I'll put some bags down or whatever, she looks straight at the window, whoo, and they have that bark, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, constant. So, now I don't want to go out back because she's out there. Then my neighbor next door on the left of me, he has a, an Akita who I love her. She's beautiful. I love her, um, but now [INAUDIBLE] in and out four times prison this and that. His wife moved to Florida, but she comes to visit. She pays his bills. Oh please, and, and now he locks her in the basement 'cause now he's working for ten hours a day. So, that's killing me. It's breaking my heart.And she doesn't bark?When [NAME OTHER] isn't at home, she barks constantly. It's not so much the barking from [NAME OTHER].Um-hum.It's, it's breaking my heart 'cause she's in the basement.Not outside. Yeah.Yknow.Would you offer to dog sit?I don't want to do that.Okay.You know why, because he, he, he borrowed money off of us here and there, and I thought he was doing okay and he needed it because he's not working and, and [NAME OTHER] living in Florida, but yet she pays his bills, and then, then I realized he's, he's buying stuff with that money.Sure.So, yknow.Did he ever pay you back?He asked us, oh, no, no. He asked us if we, if I would let her in and out and [NAME OTHER] said I'm not, no. I'm not going to let [NAME OTHER] do that. No.Yeah, too much responsibility.It's too much responsibility with him like, I don't know what he takes, but it's always twenty dollars, twenty dollars. So, I don't know what that is. I don't really care to know, but, um, if I come in and out of his house, and he, whatever he takes, he might accuse me of taking something.Yeah.You know what I mean? So, you have to really go to the extreme with your mind to, to keep yourselfYeah. Yeah.Yknow.I know what you mean.Yknow, um, but I give her water outside when he does put her outside.Um-hum.Um, and I always, when I go to the PetSmart for my cats I get dog biscuits for, yknow.Yeah.I, I'm just an animal lover, and yknow, it's like okay, I can't go in the back and I haven't, I need to go out in the back.Um-hum. Well, I mean it sounds like that your one next neighbor is not necessarily the issue about going out back. It's more the Chihuahua.Right.It sounds like you just need to talk to your neighbor.I know, and I'm going to have, it's going, it has to be like [NAME OTHER] do you think there's some way that [NAME OTHER] and I could become friends because I love to be out in my garden, yknow. Is there any kind of treat or some kind of a thing that, yknow, we could do. I just can't go out and say, yknow, [NAME OTHER] can you give me a break, is which I really want to say.Does [NAME OTHER] work?Yeah, but I don't think she works as much as she used to.So the dog isSo, [NAME OTHER] is out.Insides sometimes?Right. And when she don't chain her up, she gets out of the little nooks and crannies, goes down the alley and then, um, reversed. Then I'm worried she got out.Right. Right. Then you're taking the responsibility.Right. I feel, it's like when people go away, we have a street cleaning thing on Thursdays; can you move my car 'cause we're going to Florida. I don't go nowhere. I'm like, yknow, the, the, the dog person, um, um, the valet.You're the reliable neighbor.Oh yeah, but yet people treat me like crap.Yeah. I mean if that's the case and these are people are asking you, then I mean I would say no.I do.If it's too [INAUDIBLE].I am saying no.Good. Good.I am saying no.Yeah, I mean I think that's reasonable.Yknow, like the one lady on the end, she's in her [AGE] and her son's in his [AGE], but can you take us over to the doctor? Can't do it [NAME OTHER]. It's like I tell [NAME OTHER] take my car to work because they see my car parked outside, [NAME OTHER] always home, and that's not the case, yknow. I have a job. I'm nonstop all day.Um-hum.And I'm still crying every day. I'm going through thing where I gained like six pounds in the past like month and a half. I can't stand it. I'm eating sweets, which is not me, and it reminds me of years ago when I was really badWell, you definitely are not overweight.I know.Definitely not.I know.You always tend to fall on the side of the underweight side.I know.So, six pounds. Even though it may be six pounds, it's, it's not obvious.I know, but it is to me.You look healthy.Well maybe 'cause I'm tanning a little bit.[INAUDIBLE].But, um, yknow, it's like I got my mom and [NAME OTHER] to where don't call me at night.Good.They're getting, I don't even want to say 'cause as soon as you say they're getting along, boom.Yeah, I know, then, thenYknow.You just have to expect the worst for them.I know.But if they're not calling in the evening, you can count your blessings, yknow, 'cause, yknow, some of the stuff that they have to go through, they have to work out on their own. There's nothing that you can work out for them, yknow, that you're always kind of the one in the middle, and that if you're not finding myself not in the middle, then just appreciate, yknow. You know what I'm saying, if you're not getting thoseYeah.Calls, yknow, they have to realize they have to work it out.Right.And not put you in the middle.Right. And, yknow, I'm still crying every day, and now I'm going through I guess the change of life 'cause I haven't had my period since like September, and then all of a sudden, I'm on fire. It's like, it don't come on gradually, yknow. It's not like you're sitting there or standing there going I'm feeling a little warm. It's just I'm hot and then I'm cold. And then I went to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in the beginning of March 'cause I'm, my hands are numb in the morning, and I'm not, I know I probably have a pinched nerve 'cause sometimes it really stops me in my tracks. Um, so he wants me to have an MRI because, um, every now and then I get so dizzy to where I have to have my hands over my eyes and try and feel my way to, to lay down, and it, it wakes me up. I don't know what that is, um, so, I, yknow, and plus I want to call to see 'cause I usually get blood work when I'm there once a year. So, I want to see, get the blood work done and then have the test done and see if my, my equilibrium might be off or, yknow, potassium or my cholesterol might be high, or I mean or something. I'm a diabetic, and yknow if you're diabetic and once you get blood work done.Well, blood work or if you're urinating a lot and drinking a lot of water. I mean that's one of the signs, but usuallyI'm not extremely thirsty.Yeah.Yknow, so that's not anything.If it runs in the family.No, I don't think it runs on my Dad's side, but we don't know 'cause my Mom was adopted.Right, and your Mom doesn't have it.No, no.Her side.And so, and I'm worried about [NAME OTHER] and his health. He snores and God, he snores like I never heard anybody snore before. It's like, and then he goes into like a, a whistle and then like a cry. And then I'll hear him breathing, and I'll be downstairs.What's his work hours?He snores like crazy. He's eating like crazy. He's gaining weight like crazy.What's his work hours now?Oh, he's slow right now, which is surprising.Oh.Yknow, but we did go up to see his friends in, was it in, like a month ago, [DEIDENTIFIED] or that I've only been in their company maybe three times.Um-hum.They're like, they're really nice people. They're like, like still living in the hippie days, but they're in their sixties, yknow.Sure.And they got, oh, it's funny. SoSo you got out? You went to [INAUDIBLE]?Yes, and all morning he was in bed, I was down in the, in the basement living room and for an hour I was talking out loud, I'm not going. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go.But you went?But I went.And did you enjoy it?Yeah, I did because I didn't just sit at the table. I went around the whole house because she's got stuff, like there's a show on Home and Garden TV called What's With that House? Well, she got every nook and cranny crammed with this little things and I mean[INAUDIBLE].The whole house.Collector?Or everything.[INAUDIBLE].But, but, but, yeahThat you had in common?Yeah, but I'm, my house is veryNot as cluttered.It isn't cluttered at all, but when I go to other people's houses, I enjoy that, yknow. So, I kept myselfWell, that's great.Busy.But it sounds like you were trying to talk yourself out of it before you went.Oh, I always do.No, it's good 'cause I think, yknow, I mean if it's slow right now, maybe this is the time to work on doing something else special I mean likeIt's not happening. We only go out if we're invited.No, no trip to the shore?No. Huh-uh, it's not happening.[INAUDIBLE] someplace. No.Because he would do the same thing at home that he would do when we were away.Sleep.I know this. Um-hum, yeah. He's not the sightseer orYeah.Let's get away from the neighborhood kind of type.He needs to be away from the neighborhood, which is exactly what I was thinking that it gives you a chance toYeah, and actually that'sGet beyond your, your block, which obviously has a lot of stress when you spend so much time there, yknow.And, and the funny thing is I live across the street from a church, which there's nobody looking back at you.Yeah. Yeah.But I'm just, every day is, I know things can't be perfect. I can't tell [NAME OTHER] what to do. I can't tell [NAME OTHER] what to do, but I can ask.Yeah. I think unless, unless [NAME OTHER] knows that, um, her ChihuahuaI don't know how it don't bother her.She must be used to it or maybe [INAUDIBLE].No, 'cause whenever she's home, [NAME OTHER] out.Um-hum.Whenever [NAME OTHER] out, [NAME OTHER] barks.Well, it sounds like with [NAME OTHER] her way of dealing with it is to not have, not have her dog in the house. Soon as she gets home, put the dog out, yknow.But she has to still hear her barking. Oh my God. It's from a little tiny dog, what a bark, and I love animals, and I justYou need the quiet.Yeah.Um-hum.And then it seems like on nice days, I have all this stuff to do. I had to take my Mom and all her taxes down. I just dropped them out and then the man [NAME OTHER] does 'em, and, uh, it's like trying to get work done. It would be like I tell my sister, take three hours like at, at noon, go somewhere for three hours and come back at three and try and catch on those three hours. See nobody gets the fact that I work at home.Yeah.I do everything so that nobody else has to.Yeah.But, and then there's times it goes through my head, I'm just going to kill myself, yknow, just going to kill myself because I can't, I need some peace.Um-hum.But that don't stay with me.Yeah, it comes and goes.Yeah.But it's more like a feeling of frustration that you get, yknow, when you're feeling pushed to a particular limit that you start feeling that way. You know you always seem to handle all these things that are there. I mean, yknow, with all, with the all people that, that are putting pressure on, that you feel pressure from like your family and even your neighbors, you always seem to succeed. I mean you seem to still, yknow, do what you need to do and take care of the things you need to get done, yknow.Um-hum.It's just I wish that there were some moments that you were able to enjoy a little bit more too, but it sounds like you'reIt's rare.Yeah.It's so rare. I haven't worked in, um, in ten years. Never had a day off in ten years. I can't stand it.Well, now who's your boss right now?Me.Okay. So, yknow, in terms of taking a day off, it's also something that, that you need to allow yourself, yknow, but I think you get so driven with certain things that you feel you need to get done.I do.That it's hard for you to just kind of say okay, yknow, I'm just going to take a day off today. Yknow, you're your own boss, but you're your own tough boss if you know what I'm saying.Yeah.And it wouldn't be the end of the world to take a day off and give yourself that opportunity, but I think you have to prepare yourself not to be down on yourself if you didn't accomplish that day. It's okay to have a [INAUDIBLE] day.Yeah.You know what I mean? You'd have to say to yourself, it's okay, yknow.Yeah.It's okay to go shopping or, yknow, goof off.That's the other thing. I hate, hate shopping. I hate it for anything, clothesBut you liked going to the craft store, didn't you?And that closed. SoFind another one.I did. I did. When I was up [NAME OTHER], uh, I said on the way up there, I said to [NAME OTHER] I said geez, I really miss [DEIDENTIFIED] 'cause see they didn't just sell fabrics. They sold all kinds of little windchimes and stuff that I like putting outside and all. So when I went up to [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER], I, I was telling her and she said, oh, there's another store better than that, and then she was showing me all this other stuff that she bought. It's called the [DEIDENTIFIED], and she said people think it's just Christmas stuff. So, there's one in, in a [DEIDENTIFIED], but there's so, I called and here there's one right over in [DEIDENTIFIED].Oh, okay.So, she said they sell everything.And did Joann's Fabrics close across the country orNo, no, no, no.Did they all close or just the one store?Just the one store I found out.'Cause they're, they're a chain, right?They closed the one that I go to on [DEIDENTIFIED], 'cause they're building a Target there where, where the movie theater was and all, which I didn't know there was another one around, and [NAME OTHER] said yeah, there's one right up by her, and hereThere's, um, there used to be just up near [DEIDENTIFIED] there were like two huge, I forget the names of them, two huge craft stores right by the, not in the mall, but [INAUDIBLE].Yeah, Michael's, there's Michael's and then there'sThere's another one.Yeah, that just opened.They're in the same strip mall.Yeah.Like they're both like right next to each other practically.Yeah, Ace, not Ace. I know. My, my neighbor gives me the sale paper all the time.So, I guess my point is that I know that you don't like to do certain shoppingYeah, but I like that.But I remember you have liked to go craft shoppingOh yeah.You know what I mean. Yknow, starting projects or, yknow, and againYeah.Yes, that can feel like work, but yknow, it's more, it's less mundane. It's like doing something that you enjoy doing and, yknowIf I'm creative every day, I, I enjoy that.Yeah, then that's your, that's your break, yknow.That's my break.Yeah. So I would say, yknow, why not?Oh yeah.[INAUDIBLE] craft store.I certainly did.And do that. Yeah.I did. I did that. I called Monday to see where they were located.Uh-huh.And, uhGo visit.Yeah, I am. I am going to go do that.Doctor's order.But it's like, yeah. If I, if I have to go buy clothes and stuff, I just hate it.Or grocery shopping or that kind of stuff.Oh, hate it. And I also got, um, [NAME OTHER] right, yeah.Um-hum.She, she already wrote me two letters 'cause I got jury duty.Oh, Uh-huh.Okay. So, she had sent them out. Well, they claim they never got it. So, then I got to show up for jury one trial or one, um, two days or one trial.And that's in the city of [DEIDENTIFIED]?Well, she claims it's government, federal and county. So, um, I said, yknow, my doctor's secretary already sent two letters, and she said well we never got them. She says did they use the word excused. I was like I don't get it. So I said I'm going there tomorrow, and then, um, so I, I told [NAME OTHER] and then I told the woman on the phone that I'll send another letter if that's okay.Let me write up your, I'm assuming you need the prescriptions. So, I'm going to write those real quick.Yeah, well she said she would take care of it and write up a letter for 'em, and then I have to send this in with that.Let me take a look at it then. Um, let me just see. Let me get this written up real quick for you. Are you taking any Klonopin during the day?Yes.Okay. You're taking half twice a day?Yes.Okay 'cause before you were only taking it at bedtime, right?No, I was taking it during the day.Okay.And you said I could take an extra half if I couldn't sleep. Well, I don't. I don't take that extra half. I take half, half and whole.That's how it's written. Let me give you these and now I'll take a look at that. I've never seen one quite that big.Yeah, well it's the whole thing. It's all the instructions and what, what, where to go.Here's the prescription.Okay, thank you.Yep, let me take a look.Usually it's the postcard they send you.Yeah.Well, they didn't get the letter twice. She looked it up. So, I don't get it. I, I just don't get it. I mean I really just don't.That's odd.So, if, if twice I ignored the postcard that I've been selected for jury dutyDid, did you send the letter with the postcard like when you sent the postcard backWellWas the letter that [NAME OTHER] typed up, were they together?Well, I don't think I sent the postcard, but it has your identification number.'Cause there's usually, there's the little postcard and then there's a couple of things that you check.Right. I did do that.Usually just says that I can't, and then you attach the note.Right.So you can send the two back together.Right.I wonder if the two were sent back separately like the letter was sent and your card was sent 'cause unless [NAME OTHER] had your ID numbersYeah, sheFrom the card.Right. Yeah, because she did have the ID number.And it was on the letter? But did she have the card?I'm pretty sure because she had to answer questions.That's odd. Well, yknow, talk to [NAME OTHER] and see 'cause she'll probably have a copy of whatever she sent too 'cause she keeps those on file.Yeah, so, so I did, and she said well show it to you and then she would type something up, but to let you know all about it.Let's see here. One, two, three, four. So the next visit would be the first week and second week in June, [DATE]. Want to do June [DATE], eight thirty?I just want to make sure I'm not going to the gynecologist. Okay, I'm not going till the [DATE] of June so.I'll give you a card.[DATE] is fine.Okay.Okay.Okey doke. Turn this off.", 'Let\'s not bother today.Let\'s see how we get on shall we? We can just try it if we don\'t like it, huh?All right.[I think once you\'ve got your time if you just forget you\'ve got the time] (ph) [inaudible]All right. Maybe we can talk about [audio blip]Anything you want.and this virus (ph)?Anything you [audio blip] m-hmm.Yeah, I remember [overlapping voices]Just one of our usual sessions.Yeah, so then you [inaudible] said "no", but we\'re not going to do that, [it\'s not] (ph) all about that?All right. Well why do you want to start talking about it?Well I, today I had what did you have for breakfast today?Let me think. I was lazy this morning, I slept in, and then all I had was some grapefruit, a boiled egg and some bread and marmalade. What did you have for breakfast? [0:01:00.5]I had so two boiled [inaudible] I had two boiled eggs and some bacon.M-hmm, did you have any [overlapping voices]I have a fear that this tape and this recording might interfere with our work. So I have the feeling that it makes me less tense when we\'re talking through the tape recording because it gives me something new to think about. Don\'t you think having new things to think about helps?Well it\'s kind of interesting.Will we have him record it back once we get through?Aye (ph), I think we should listen to it don\'t you?Listen to it?Aye.Will we have time to listen to it before the hours up?No, but I don\'t have to go away immediately we finish our hour, because we started early it\'s possible to start till three [overlapping voices]Then we can listen to it.and we can ask Dr. Berlin to play it to us so we can hear what we said.Before the hand gets around to three?Yeah. No, we\'ll be stopping about 20 of four, and if we stop at 20 of four we can listen to about 10 minutes of our recording.Uh-huh. [0:02:01.0]But you were saying that you were uneasy, that it might interfere with our work in some way. How do you think?Well I think that it might interfere with our work or it might interfere with my cigarette.How do you think it might do that then?Well I don\'t know. Well [risk taking] (ph) and sounds now?I guess it must be.M-hmm.What does it feel like to be [overlapping voices]Pretty good.be taken in like that? You\'re not finding it so bad then?It\'s possible we could just try it for a couple of minutes and not the whole time we talk, just try it for a minute or so.Well we\'ll see how we get on.And then have him record it back into us.M-hmm.Maybe so.But if you, how do you think it might interfere with our work or with your cigarette?Well I mean it may not give them an idea that you shouldn\'t give me the cigarette, the people when they\'re studying us, one of the docs you work with, I mean it might give them the idea that you shouldn\'t bring me cigarettes anymore.Do you think I\'m going to let them bully me then?Do you have your own boss still (ph)? [0:03:00.2]Who\'s my own boss?You.Right. That\'s right. You must think I\'m easily put off my stag.When can I light up my next one?There\'s a clock out there.M-hmm. When would you say I should light up my next one?Well when did we start?When did we start? Just a while ago. You know what, don\'t you think that it\'s all, uh, it\'s uh, this is like you do on television?Aye.Are there any questions you want to ask me about how this interferes with our work?You can go ahead and tell me because you seem to have some doubts about your (ph) work.Well I mean it\'s hard to tell you things. Is it all right for me to talk about what I did during the day, about my day?You just tell me what you usually talk about, it\'s fine with me.I mean remember when I would today I had two boiled eggs. I mean I had, for lunch I had some salmon and some lettuce. And I\'ve only had two cigarettes today. And I haven\'t had any extra cigarettes today. [0:04:06.9]You\'ve had three then because you smoked one here, right?I know it but, uh, I didn\'t have any besides that.You mean that you didn\'t have any extra ones in the school?That\'s what I mean.Mm, I see. But you were saying something else about being worried about the recording. Do you think these other doctors might criticize me so much I\'d be ashamed of giving you the cigarettes?Yeah. Well I have an idea that they might, uh, that they might criticize you for giving me the cigarettes, do you see what I mean?Aye, I see.They might tell you not to give me them.Oh, I see.Right, so do you think that was [inaudible] do you think that I have to worry about that?Well what do you think then? Have I given you any impression I\'m the sort of person that\'s susceptible to that?No.Hmm?No. Did you mention to me about the cigarettes the first time? Did my mother ask you?Uh-huh.And you told her that you were free to do what you wanted to do.That\'s right. [0:05:00.2]Remember long ago I never asked you for a cigarette, and then one day I came in and said "can I please have a cigarette"? And then you said "this is the first time you\'ve asked me for a cigarette". Do you remember that?M-hmm, I remember that.I mean so you know there\'s lots of things we\'ve got to talk about before I won\'t ever have the horrible feeling again isn\'t there?Yeah, I think. It strikes me that one of the things that bothers you is that you think people who are working with you are very much influenced by other folks\' opinions.Well what do you mean? Well give me an example.Well the one that you\'ve just given me about the effect of these other doctors\' opinions on my work.M-hmm. Well [overlapping voices]Can you give me any examples from your own living (ph) of where this happened? Where someone was doing something and because another person criticized they stopped doing it?I don\'t know, I can\'t think of any offhand.Were there any in your family at all?I can\'t think of it offhand. But there\'s then would you say that this has but would you say that this is [for the idea] (ph) or this is [audio blip] decided to stop giving me the cigarettes because my mother told her not to because she had been giving me so many cigarettes, or remember that?Oh, yes, that\'s those things. Did you [overlapping voices]Now for instance, so to change the subject for a minute. I can see that this is going to be very helpful to us, this may be very helpful to you, and it might be very helpful to me. Don\'t you suppose it might be very helpful to me in a way? Because I can hear what we\'ve been talking about, don\'t you think? [0:06:33.1]I would be dishonest if I said that the purpose of making this recording is to help you, I don\'t think it really is.But it\'s to help you?It could be very useful to me and it might be very useful to people like Dr. Berlin who are trying to study the way different doctors are working.Yes, but I don\'t think I think they\'d be very nice about this, uh, situation and just not you know.Well we will raise hell with them if they\'re not.M-hmm, [I bet they are] (ph).You\'re keen to protect me from any kind of embarrassment or criticism, huh?Maybe we better take it off now and [overlapping voices]I\'m quite comfortable with mine on if [audio blip] mind.Will you tell him to stop? You can tell him to stop anytime you want can\'t you?We can if we want to, but I think now that we\'ve started we should just finish it.Okay and we can listen to it before I go?Yeah, that\'s right. Now is there anything else special on your mind you wanted to talk to me about (ph) [audio blip]? [0:07:34.2]Oh, about I had a dream but I can\'t seem to remember it. I mean I can\'t seem to remember everything (ph).You can\'t or you don\'t want to? Is it a difficult dream?It\'s hard to remember. I think it was something to do or something to do with my mother.[Why not do you think] (ph)?And I keep dreaming that I\'m over at my grandmother\'s apartment in Baltimore.Were you dreaming about this last night that you were in Baltimore?Well I think something like that.Oh, I see.I oftentimes will dream that I go from here up to Baltimore to my grandmother\'s apartment to stay with my grandmother. I keep having that dream. And (chuckling) I keep having the dream that I see my father (coughing). Should we tell him to stop now?I\'m quite comfortable with it on [audio blip]Stop now? I think this is better than nothing. Would you tell him to stop now?Let\'s keep it going to a wee while longer, eh?May I smoke my next one now?Okay, sure. [0:08:26.6]This is very interesting, no?Well it will be good fun for us to hear our voices afterwards and the kind of things we said.We\'re now on?M-hmm. Well what was happening in the dream with regard to your mother, you mentioned she was in it?Yes. She, uh, had, uh, uh, she I mean a dream that she came up to see me and I well you see there\'s something I\'m afraid to tell you about.Is there any parts that you\'re afraid to talk about?Well let\'s talk about all the things in a different, in a line, you know talk about them you know one after another?Well I was just wondering what consequences you\'d [overlapping voices] [0:09:25.5]First let\'s talk about the recording and about how I feel about the recording. You don\'t think that\'s important to talk about today?Yeah, and we could probably be talking about this for some time [audio blip]Well I felt that this is something new to me and is very interesting to me and maybe we could work better. I felt that maybe we could work better with this.Maybe we\'ll be able to, especially when [overlapping voices]And maybe we could get out the tape recorder. What do you think of this arrangement, take a tape recorder and, and uh, do tape recording all the time?Well as I\'ve got [audio blip]And have our own tape recorder and just keep it private to ourselves and not have anybody ask to hear it except us.Well that\'s a thought.And then play it back for us.You mean you\'re not too content about Dr. Berlin and other people hearing what goes on, eh?That\'s more (ph) what I mean.[Yeah, I know] (ph).Can you hear what goes on outside?I should think so, yes, I should think so. [0:10:24.6]You sound pretty [audio blip] [for this].Mm, I don\'t think they\'ll [audio blip] to hear though.No?Because Dr. Berlin has a special thing that fits into his ears. But what trouble do you think would arise if [audio blip] what was going on out there?Well but there\'s some things that I\'m [going to throw they\'re] (ph) afraid of.Well what do you think might happen if you [inaudible] went on in here?Well it effect me having a cigarette tonight or [overlapping voices]Oh, I see, you mean you might be punished for criticizing him, huh?And he might keep (ph) me off the cigarettes.Mm, you wouldn\'t like that very much would you?Of course. Would you be willing to call him in to talk to him about the situation if I thought that it was necessary?Yes.If I asked you to do it?Yes, I would. But tell me, do you not think you can manage to deal with him yourself?Well I feel I\'m getting along better with [audio blip] anybody that\'s stern. But yet he\'s trying to help me and I do like, in some ways though I do like Mr. [audio blip] so (ph). [0:11:24.5]Do you not think he might manage to you might manage to talk to him yourself?Oh, I don\'t know, that\'s hard to say. I don\'t think I could get away with him, he\'s so stern.Yeah, but do you not think you can manage to make a reasonable position clear to him?Well how can I learn to do that?In here.How can I learn in here to do that?Well then you make your position pretty clear to me don\'t you?Uh-huh.Do you ever find it difficult to persuade me to change my mind?Well, for instance, one night it was difficult for you when you had, took the cigarettes away from me, because I asked if you broke your rules and asked the people for cigarettes in here.Oh, aye, I remember that night. You were kind of cross with me on that occasion. [0:12:22.4]Well I tried to get you to change your mind. And oftentimes I try to get too long or I try to get you to change your mind about three cigarettes and let me have more cigarettes in here, and get you to change your mind and give me another cigarette.Oh, I see. You sound as though you find me a kind of difficult person at times.And the thing I\'m worrying about tonight, because I have so, we have so much time on our hands, that I don\'t get the extra cigarette and then I won\'t be able to you know. Is it all right if we play back what we heard right this minute?Let\'s wait till the end [audio blip] want to interrupt our hour, because the most important thing is for us to have our session together. I mean the recording may be fine (ph) [overlapping voices]Do you think we\'ve done very good work tonight?Well we\'ve talked mostly about the recording. I think you\'ve stated your case on it pretty clearly and told me what doubts you had.That isn\'t good work though.Yeah, I guess it is. Yeah, I think so. [0:13:20.1](Chuckling)What are you laughing about, hmm?When (ph) one dime is left for the telephone, "now listen to me".Okay."You\'ve been a naughty, naughty, selfish" I said, "Would you please give me something to make me feel (ph) better?" And she said, "Now listen to me. You\'re being a naughty, naughty, selfish", (pause) I was asking.As (ph) you certainly want the whole world to know what a difficult person Miss [audio blip] anyway, eh (chuckling)?M-hmm.You were awaiting your chance to get that in weren\'t you?Uh-huh (other chuckling).Are you still finding her difficult?Well I feel a little bit nervous when I\'m with her.Oh, in what way?Okay, so there I was with her today. I went into the kitchen to smoke a cigarette and she said I thought and did things. I mean naturally she didn\'t object to it because she knew that that was the rule and she didn\'t say anything about it, she just talked to me while I was smoking a cigarette right in front of her and she didn\'t say anything about it because she, you know why that was, because that she knew that I was allowed to have it. [0:14:36.5]Aye.And if I hadn\'t been allowed to have it she would\'ve been cross about it wouldn\'t she? Don\'t you suppose she would\'ve?All right, so?The reason she, uh, didn\'t say (voice starting to tremble) anything about it because she knew that I was suppose to have it, knew that I was following the rules, right, and knew that I was only right that I should have it. Don\'t you suppose that was?I guess so. I guess so.And if they\'d been asked to give me more cigarettes and they had no objections.And you think the rules are kind of handy sometimes to help you handle people?Well I don\'t know, I feel less [inaudible], feel less tangled up in this school now that [I\'m I mean] (ph) allowed to smoke, I feel less mad at the school.And you\'re not so fed up with them, right?I feel fed up with them. No kidding, it\'s the third day when I get my medicine, and the fourth day that I just get fed up because I\'m taking the pills.Well that was a theory I gave you. What do you think about it?Oh, yeah. [0:15:35.2]Mm, are you convinced?M-hmm. What does convinced mean?Oh, sure.Sure?M-hmm.One time Mrs. [audio blip] she said to me, "Ought to be sure!" She said, "Be sure." And, uh, I said, uh, "Be", uh, you know, and I said, "So you think about it carefully and you tell me the real answer. Don\'t just say sure!" Remember the other day Mrs. [audio blip] called me selfish. I could talk about all the people that have called me selfish and all the people that have called me foolish and, and all the people that have called me rude!Now is the time to do it because you can let the whole world know through the recordings (both chuckling).But I mean, yeah, are you sure that this won\'t, but I want to and (ph) get something real straight with you about this, then (ph) I you to be serious about this. Are you sure that nobody will, uh, find or will, uh, for, keep me from having cigarettes or if they hear about this? [0:16:35.4]I\'m quite sure. But what I\'d like to know is why you\'re so uncertain of my strength to deal with other people?But do you think that that will interfere with this in any way?Well why do you have doubts of it? You do seem to doubt my ability [overlapping voices]I\'m so afraid these doctors might, they feel that you shouldn\'t give me cigarettes.I see.And I\'m afraid even me hearing and just talk about this might have affect.I see. But tell me, have you noticed in the past that I seemed likely to be influenced by what other people said to me?Mm, I don\'t think you\'d, uh, take the influence by it because you\'ve said maybe clear it with Miss [audio blip] [I would be too glad] (ph) to be free to do what you wanted.There\'s still a wee doubt in your mind though [audio blip] still worries you a bit.What is the wee doubt do you think?I\'m not too sure, it\'s just that you keep saying that you\'re concerned that maybe the criticisms of those other doctors will make me stop doing something that you like me to do. [0:17:34.2]Yes. Remember the first time I started coming to see you I started talking about a lot of obsessional (ph) ideas [overlapping voices]Aye.and a lot of doubt? And does this thing take in the sound like this?It\'s a microphone.Just (ph) [audio blip] speak into it like that or just [overlapping voices]No, you don\'t, and you don\'t need to pay any attention to the thing (other chuckling), and with this you can even get up and walk around and not worry about it.Uh-huh. I got a record, uh, ["The Big Hurt"] (ph).Oh, you told me about that yesterday [audio blip]I, uh, I told you yesterday I went up to the, of all the things I did yesterday, you don\'t want me to tell you all the things, like today when I first got up I took a bath, a shower, and then I shaved myself, put on some shaving lotion, and I went to the table and ate my breakfast and then I made up my bed. And now I, [overlapping voices]Was there anybody with you at breakfast?So I went to Mr. [audio blip] class and he talked about a community and about the com, and the root word for community being common. And we or I had, uh, before I left, and though I didn\'t pay much attention to what Mr. [audio blip] was saying in class, I thought that was quite a strain and I got through with the down at Miss [audio blip] I had a good lesson down at Miss [audio blip] had a good time down at Mrs. [audio blip] the other day. Had a good lesson down at Mrs. [audio blip] I mean. [0:18:52.7]M-hmm. I noticed you didn\'t mention anything of the new school teacher [audio blip]Well I feel he\'s very, uh, he insists that I do certain things. Once he asked me to do something, he insists that I keep on doing it. For instance he\'ll say, "Would you please, uh, go out and rake up the leaves and rake up a few leaves in the yard?" And then I have to say, "I\'ll, can I, uh, write some letters?" And he says, "I told you to go out and rake up the leaves, so I think you better go out and rake up the leaves first before you do that." And then I\'m, and then once I start [overlapping voices] [0:19:23.4]Did he say that to you this morning?Yes, he did. And then, uh, and then I [overlapping voices]What did you think he meant?Said I wanted to do something else. And, and we\'re starting to, uh, straighten out my records, to get my records all in order. I did that this morning just so that we can make a list of all my records I have so my mother won\'t duplicate me when she gets me other records. [Audio blip] I\'m looking forward to my mother coming up to see me tomorrow. She\'s coming up Wednesday.Is she?But I haven\'t told her what she\'s to bring me.You haven\'t, m-hmm.Do you think that this will probably, it will make the hour go by much quicker won\'t it, because we have something interesting, instrument to work with?Not for me.Would you forget (ph) the, I think of getting you an, uh, our own private tape recorder so that we, just you and I could record on it? We\'ll let no, and would you let nobody here about hear it?This would be for us, yeah, I won\'t (ph) [overlapping voices]There\'s nobody hear it except us, and you promise you\'ll let nobody hear it except us? [0:20:22.3]I keep my word.And you promise that you, or would never see anybody in the school unless it\'s in my presence and without giving me fair warning?That\'s right.Ahead of time if, I mean Miss [audio blip] was to be [inaudible] obviously being the new teacher, again, if it was to be Miss [audio blip]Yeah, though you may remember [audio blip] you said if it was an absolutely emergency and your treatment was threatened [overlapping voices]M-hmm.I might have to see them.Did you feel, was your reason for seeing the teacher; was it something to do with our work? Was it something to do with our work being threatened?No, it wasn\'t, but I thought it would be to the advantage of our work if I saw him.And just how many minutes have we got now?But you had grave doubts about that didn\'t you [audio blip]When do we stop?There\'s the clock.When do we stop? When the hand gets around to where?When it gets around to the eight.M-hmm, and then we can, and when are we then we\'re going to hear our work?Yeah, we can.Can we hear the whole hour?We won\'t have time to hear the whole hour [audio blip] it will take an hour to clear (ph). [0:21:23.0]But we\'ll take and hear a few of it?A bit of it, yeah. We can hear the high points, where we\'ve been especially clever both of us, huh?Uh-huh. How will we, how will it come back, the sound to us?Very good.Through this?No, he, Dr. Berlin will bring the machine in and we can hear it.Uh-huh (coughing). You know what, and, yes, my mother is getting me a collie, [inaudible]Well so you tell me [audio blip]M-hmm.So I guess it must be so, eh?Do you know what, do you, don\'t you do you wish that I could tell you these dreams?Well it was something about your mother in this one that you were going to tell me about.Uh-huh, but you know oftentimes I feel very, uh, I mean it\'s hard for me to go ahead and tell you this, especially with a tape recording machine to record. Mm, will they play it back to us next time we come up?I would doubt it. What you do is he promised he would send me the tape recording when he goes back to Wisconsin. [0:22:28.8]And then what will we do with it?And then you and I can play it together.On this machine?No, I\'ll have to buy a machine of my own.And we can play it together on that?Yeah.Are you going to buy a machine? When are you going to buy a machine?As soon as I recover from the affects of paying my income tax.You\'ll buy a machine (laughter in voice)?Yeah.Will this fit it?Yeah.One that this will fit? Will it be just like this?I think probably I won\'t be able to afford as good a one as this.But it will still hold this same film?M-hmm.Can this film be played over my tape recorder at home?Probably [audio blip]M-hmm?Probably.Uh-huh. You know what, I feel a little tense. Now I feel less tense [don\'t I] (ph)?That\'s a kind of contradictory message.Yeah, so what do you mean a contradictory message?M-hmm, you said one thing and then the other immediately afterward.Do you think the horrible feeling has anything to do [with when I saw her] (ph)? [0:23:27.5]What do you think?No. You know oftentimes you see, uh, oh, a design, see, uh, designs in the air don\'t you with the designs, isn\'t that right?M-hmm.Isn\'t it?[Well I think it could be a fabulous thing] (ph).It must be a confusion of thoughts. It must not be anything serious but it seems serious for the moment doesn\'t it? Do you feel that [overlapping voices][Well it\'s not really] [overlapping voices]the horrible feeling is not (ph) a serious form of discomfort?You don\'t seem to enjoy it.No, (chuckling) I don\'t enjoy it one bit.No.When shall I light up my next cigarette?Well wait to see. How long have you got to go [audio blip]When the hand gets down to there. Do you think we should be recording our whole hour?M-hmm.Do you?Yeah, just for fun.Of course you don\'t seem as serious when you\'re not talking, when it\'s, when we\'re by yourself we\'re doing it. [0:24:27.6]Probably not. I think you\'re probably right there.Or (chuckling) you\'re being a little bit out of, uh, of seriousness.And we\'re paying attention to what we\'re saying.Do you feel that bad? The way I feel about the tape recorder is that, uh, we should, uh, uh, talk through the tape; that this might interfere with our work in some way because we couldn\'t be as serious as we were without it. Don\'t you think sometimes we should talk without the tape recorder sometimes, and sometimes with it?M-hmm, I don\'t think we should use (ph) [overlapping voices]And I felt that this was something new and yet I thought it was something that would get you less tense. When I ask something, why is it I feel less, more relaxed now that we\'re talking with a tape recorder than I would without it?Do you think you are [audio blip]Because it, so it gives me something interesting to think about.Oh, I would wonder if you are [audio blip] because it strikes me that you\'ve been pretty uneasy today about this tape recording.Well I felt very uncomfortable in the car when I was coming up.Oh? [0:25:26.6]Is it all right to do this with the cord?Yes [audio blip] What were you uncomfortable about [audio blip]In my head, so I thought I was going to have a horrible feeling, a little bit worried today, because this is about the fifth day I\'ve had my medicine. So I had my medicine, uh, I mean I think it was at, yeah, the night before Easter, mm, and then I had it the next day and then I had it that night, and then I had it Monday morning and I had it Monday night, and then I had again this morning.Could it by any chance have something to do with the fact that we talked about making this recording yesterday [audio blip] that you were uneasy on your way up here? Did you worry about it [at all] (ph)?No, I didn\'t worry about it.You didn\'t?You know I have to just sort of, I kind of forgot about it.Oh, you\'d forgot until you came in here?M-hmm. Did you tell me before that you were going to bring up a machine?Yes. You said yesterday that you didn\'t mind making it, remember?Yes. Could you please have them take off the tape recorder now? Tell him to stop it? [0:26:25.6]Oh, we\'ve made more than half of it [audio blip] I think we should finish.Now that you mention it could you, would you be willing to stop it now?If you insisted but I [overlapping voices]Well I think I [overlapping voices]Personally am quite comfortable with it on.Would you turn it off now?It doesn\'t make me uncomfortable [audio blip]Would you turn it off now? Can I light up my next cigarette now?Go ahead [audio blip]M-hmm. [Smoking and silence from 0:26:52.0 to 0:27:08.2] It doesn\'t make you uncomfortable?No, it doesn\'t bother me a bit. It bothers you though a bit.A little bit. You don\'t think it\'s nicer when you can [overlapping voices]Can you give me any other example [audio blip] somebody\'s behavior to you has changed because an outside individual interfered? [0:27:29.4]I can\'t think of any offhand.Well I was wondering if it ever happened with your mother [audio blip]Well that\'s a long story, I\'ll tell you about that some other time.No, I\'d like you to tell me about it now, nah?Well I\'ll tell you about it some other time [inaudible]Now you\'re teasing me. You don\'t want it recorded and that\'s the thing.That\'s it.I see. Do you think this may be that you\'re uneasy that your mother may find out about it and what we\'ve been saying, hmm?Oh, I never did, thought of that much.Oh, no?Would you just give me some explanation of what the doctors would do when they find out about our recording and our work?Just compare standards of work.And do you think they\'d just, then going to this they\'d stop to think about the situate the cigarette situation? [0:28:31.6]I don\'t know if they might. Some doctors don\'t give people cigarettes when they see them.Would they go into on this cigarette situation or not?They might talk about it.But would you have, would that stop you?What do you think [audio blip]No. [Silence from 0:28:53.9 to 0:29:03.9]What about this long story about your mother that you keep teasing me about [audio blip] hmm?Well I\'ll tell you about that some other time.Okay.Maybe next time I can come up I can [say these short ones] (ph) of all the things you know.M-hmm, well.Remember how you asked me time and time again what I thought of this teacher [audio blip]M-hmm. [Silence from 0:29:24.3 to 0:29:54.0] Have you thought anymore about [audio blip]Well I feel he\'s beginning to clamp down more.Really (ph)?But I feel that if I go along with him he will get easier, settle down a bit.In what ways do you think he\'s clamping down on you [audio blip]Oh, I don\'t know.Why do you think he\'s clamping down?Oh, and so he\'s trying to help me and trying to insist that I do these things. [Silence from 0:30:24.9 to 0:30:35.9] Shall we take it off and hear it over now?Let\'s wait till 20 of [audio blip] when our hour finishes. I don\'t want to interrupt our hour just because there\'s a tape recording being made.Let\'s wait till the hand gets down to five.Goes round to eight, mm?Yeah, uh-huh.That\'s when our hour finishes. That\'s right you can walk around with your thing [audio blip] [Silence from 0:30:58.8 to 0:31:15.4]Do you know, um (ph)?No, what would you like me to know [audio blip]Do you know who\'s a person I like better than this teacher [audio blip] gone (ph).Hmm, you haven\'t told me much about Dr. [audio blip] what\'s his name [audio blip] so tell me about Dr. [audio blip]He looked something like my father. Let\'s turn it off now and hear our own shit.All right, Brian (ph)?I insist.You really want it off?Yes.Can we not keep it on till we finish our hour [audio blip] [0:32:01.8]Well let\'s [audio blip] now he wouldn\'t object with you if I insist. Shall we? Just tell him to stop.Do you really insist?Yeah.Can we not keep it on till the hours up?No, let\'s stop it now.Now you have to tell him yourself [audio blip]You want me to tell him?You\'d have to then ask him to stop now.What\'s his name?Dr. Berlin.Dr. Berlin, would you please stop the thing now? Uh, we or I mean that means Dr. Cameron said for me to stop it (other chuckling).Well then I\'m sure he stopped. And can tell him, if we want him to start again we can tell him to you know? [0:32:48.4]', '(4-minute silence) I was just thinking about that when I came in today I, again, noticed what I think of as the dentist\'s smell only, uhm, this time it made me think of specifically the material used when I went to the orthodontist to have the, my teeth straightened. And, uhm, well it was even more that, that because I didn\'t have my second teeth then. But, uhm, at, I was also thinking that, I guess I don\'t know, know how old I was when I stopped wearing braces but I was still fairly young and I, I, I guess I didn\'t as I remember it, I didn\'t want to give them up. And I felt sort of disappointed and I was told that everything is finished and I didn\'t need them any more. And it sort of made me think of today when I saw Doctor BBB, at the end I asked him when I had to see him again because previous to this time, he had been seeing me more regularly than once a year because of the I-U-D. And he said I didn\'t have to come in any more except for the yearly check up. And again, I, I don\'t know I felt almost as if I were disappointed and (sniffle), and I was just thinking about it. And, I don\'t know, I I know it just seems like it\'s some kind of a prop for me but I not sure exactly how it works. (3-minute silence)Well, I\'m thinking again about this feeling when I knew I didn\'t have to go back to see Doctor BBB very often and it seems almost as if I depended on it. And but then I was thinking that I must be feeling that way about it because I feel even more so about coming here. Uhm, I don\'t know, sort of almost as if it\'s the main object. Well, coming here is kind of, the day is centered around it in, in one way. And ah, when I was feeling that way today, eh, it seemed like except I was feeling "Well, this is ridiculous" too but I think my feeling was almost as if something important was being taken out of my day, or out of I mean I didn\'t go that regularly so I don\'t know why I\'d feel that way but (Silence)Well, I\'m thinking of teaching. And I know I can\'t remember if a, if this occurred to me when I was going to the doctor of right after I left but I think it that something about the fact I used to get out and teach and then do other things. And comparing it now, thinking it\'s quite a big thing just to go see a doctor thinking it\'s quite a big thing just to go see a doctor that was coming to my mind before and does again. (Pause)Well, you know, you made the point yesterday, and the day before that uhm, you had mixed feelings about coming back to see me. When you came in you felt you were showing how angry you were that you were here. But you were almost of the other, opposite feeling also because you now are ah, thinking how it felt to lose your braces and how it feels to, ah, not be seeing Doctor BBB so often. And I think you must be thinking of those things, partly at least, because you are entertaining the idea of what it would be like to not see me. And, after all,, you haven\'t seen me for some time.(Pause) Well, it just makes me think back to how I was feeling before I stopped coming in the summer. Uhm, because and I imagine I I can\'t recall but I imagine I talked about it here too that I think I was feeling very afraid. And I don\'t know, trying to, I guess, anticipate all possible feelings when I wasn\'t coming. And but then I\'m thinking that once I stopped, I didn\'t really think much about it. I must have to some extent but I, it was, I guess it must have been I wasn\'t going to let myself think about it. (2-minute silence)Well, I just had sort of a mixture of thoughts: I was thinking that, uhm well it\'s a combination of sometimes things MSCZ said because he\'s felt I was not really trying to make things different. And I mean, he wasn\'t criticizing what I did here, specifically, but in a way he was, I guess. And uhm, and then sometimes I felt that I\'m not really trying or I don\'t know, that I\'m, I\'m making myself think I\'m trying when I\'m really not or, or some way I\'m kidding myself. And, uhm, when I\'m really not or, or some way I\'m trying kidding myself. And, uhm I don\'t know, there was something more with that.But, but then also when FNI was asking me yesterday what I was going to do this year, as if I had to be doing something specific, I began to think of that again, and, and feeling pressure because of them. And feeling it two ways: one because I guess I d, I was feeling maybe still do that somehow I was answerable to her. But, uhm, I don\'t know, it was also just sort of looking at my life and making coming here so important that then I feel it doesn\'t really matter what else I do because I\'m coming here and almost feeling that that is a part of why I want people to know what I\'m doing. Because then they\'ll think I\'m doing something.And, I don\'t know, I, I somehow have the feeling that if I keep feeling that way I don\'t know if it\'s really right to put in terms of "Then I\'m not trying" but it just well (fading out)(Pause) Well, it, I, I guess what I mean is that it seems as if I\'m making coming here my life rather than, uhm, something else my life that coming here helps butSo then when you\'re telling me how you felt angry about coming you\'re trying to deny that, right? That you feel absent, that you really do want it to be the central part of your life.Well, I think I do today but I d-, I don\'t think I did I mean maybe I was all along but I mean, I, I think I must have been feeling angry even though I might feel this too. (Pause)And I\'m not sure about this, but maybe because I think the last few days, I have been more aware of this feeling of not wanting to make, have the emphasis so great on, on what I do for my day being coming here. And uhm, sort of leaving me feeling nothing else is important and so perhaps, I was feeling angry more, I guess, at myself than (3-minute silence)Well, I\'m thinking of, uhm, at first about the fact that it seems almost as if MSCZ, both for himself and then he\'s trying to force me, I think, uhm, is trying to set out his making, beginning with this fall really a new year and, uhm, changing our life more to the way he wants it and I think, if I\'m really honest, the way I want it. And he\'s being very organized about it and about arranging things ahead and wanting things down on paper so we really know what we\'re doing. And, uhm I think more, sometimes I think it\'s more so I\'ll do things like having people to dinner and uhm, seeing any shows we want to see and things like that.But I don\'t, I don\'t know, whether it\'s to help himself or if it\'s just to help me or what but, uhm, I don\' know, I feel sort of uneasy about it. And just about how I felt coming back too. Because I did come back independent of, of this particular thing he\'s doing uhm, feeling I wanted to be more effective about making me like the way I wanted it to be. And it seems like there\'ve been many times when I felt something along that line. Maybe I haven\' I think perhaps I realize more what is not right about my life than, than I have others but I don\'t know I still have, I have this very uneasy feeling that I\'ll just fizzle out. (Pause)And what would be the result then?Uhm, I g, I think I\'m imagining if I fizzle out that it would be like last spring or since FBO was born since now we have her so she\'s part of the way I arrange my day and all. And, and I, this would be, coming here would be the major focal point. And then I\'d just sort of get other things done that had to be done and do nothing that I thought was fun I don\'t know, somehow I\'d make caring for FBO and housework take all days of the week and be sort of tired and sometimes I\'d work up to wanting to do something with other people but not, not very regularly and uhm, and I\'m imagining that, I don\' know, somehow MSCZ and I would sort of be there but not really well, communicating isn\'t very good but (pause)Well, so that what you\'re imagining then, is that your life would center around FBO and me.Yeah, and that definitely was the way I was feeling this spring. (Pause) Well, I can\'t remember specific times but the way I\'m feeling, which I\'ve already said something about, is, seems very familiar to me because I think one reason I\'m afraid of perhaps I\'m already fee that I never stop feeling that way so that\'s part of my fear, I don\' know but uhm, I think somehow I thought if I felt angry then well, I didn\'t really think it out but it seems as if by losing my anger, I\'m now afraid I\'m back where I was before and I don\'t want to be back there.And just thinking about FBO, in particular when I think about trying to find somebody who will take care of her regularly I keep thinking that if I find somebody good and I feel very confident in the person, the person\'s reliable and kind and so forth then I\'ll be able to leave FBO and not feel qualms about it. But it, maybe that\'s just putting it off to an extent. Before, I didn\'t like leaving her and maybe I really still don\'t but now I\'m sort of putting it that I can never find somebody that I feel good lea about leaving her with and uhm (Pause)Z and another thing, when I think about the question FNL asked me yesterday, I\'m sure this is probably I reacted so to it ah, is that when she asked it\'s sort of a question I think I, in a way I\'ve been asking myself because I have been feeling I don\'t want to be, have my life be the way it was last spring and uhm, and, and in just in terms of what I\'m doing myself during the day, I don\'t want it to be just simply coming here and taking care of FBO but I, I, it seems as if I don\'t really know what I do want it to become other than that. And, and I guess this is part of what I\'m afraid of, since I don\'t know then that I might do nothing about it (Pause).Yeah, well uhm, I think, eh, obviously there\'s something in for you though, that you have this fear, at the same time that it\'s something you want to get rid of, that satisfies you, or did satisfy you in a very important, central way. And I\'m rather struck that it comes up again after all that you were talking about what happened in PTN in the nature of your vacation. Because this kind of life of FBO and you and me walling off everybody else, trying to really exclude everything else, including MSCZ, must be the kind of thing again, that you wanted very much when you were a little girl. You could have your own babyAnd you could have your daddy and just the three of you and shove everybody else out, ignore everybody else. So FLA wouldn\'t be around and FYC wouldn\'t be around, much less MLWZ, and it\'s as though that\'s kind of situation that you\'ve created. /(Pause) You mean, so not wanting it makes it seem as if it really is true. (Silence) No, ah, I was just thinking too, about 2 slips that well, I made, or almost made in PTN and one I, in effect, literally did make although I caught myself just in time, in PKW. But one was when FBO would eat she sat in a place where she could see out windows and if anybody was outside she could usually see what they were doing. And in the morning my parents ran around the tennis court that\'s not too far from that window. So she\'d liked to watch them and we\'d say, "Oh here comes grandma, here comes grandpa." And one time, or I think several times after that, I almost did it but one time it was on my tongue to say "Here comes daddy." Even though it was my daddy not hers.And, uhm, and then just the other day, in PKW, a girl that I met recently, who lives in our building, was, she was talking about they were moving to another apartment within the building and how they\'d looked for other ways of finding the kind of thing they needed to live. And they decided the best thing was to stay in that building. And, uhm, then she said, "What are you going to do?" Meaning, I think, more long range and I almost said, "My father " meaning MSCZ . I don\'t know, it just, I just seem to have everybody all confused. (Silence)And then I begin to think of something that occurred in PTN that made me feel very angry at the time. That\'s, I guess it\'s part of all this because it just shows how untrue wanting this triangle relationship and only this time with my father in it rather than you. Be-, uhm, and this is part of the way things always seem to be. Uhm, ju, uh, MSCZ\'d been up there, I guess, for 3 weeks and then he went back to p, to PKW and came up the next weekend. And when he did, he brought up some of those bbc chocolates, that he loves and he sort of nominally well, he passed them to me and said, "Give them to your father." But he\'d really brought them up for everybody who\'d be there, himself included. But he, my father loves chocolates only he\'d I don\' know if he knew that particular kind but it was just sort of a gesture to give them to him but they were to be shared. And there were so many it was obvious that were they to be and, uhm, my father wouldn\'t open them.So one night MSCZ said, "Why don\'t you bring the chocolates in to your father. Maybe he\'s forgotten them? " And so I did and I tried to make sort of a joke about it. My father said, "Put them back." And I don\'t know, I took it as if he were annoyed but maybe he was just sort of, "Don\'t bother me now." Because we were all playing a game or I had come in, just joined and eh, everybody else was sort of going through a trial run. And so he might just not have wanted to think about them then but I immediately took it very much that he was very annoyed and angry that he wanted them for himself and I wasn\'t to interfere with what he was doing.And so then, the next night, which was the last night we were all going to be there, uhm, MSCZ was really getting kind of upset because he had been looking forward to these chocolates so he, he was just saying then there was nothing we could do. And FLA asked me, "What about those chocolates?" So I said, "Well maybe you can say something to daddy." And she did and he immediately opened them up..Confirming everything you\'ve always thought.(Pause) Well, the thing I keep thinking about that is that, uhm, he mayNot have felt toward me, I guess, quite the way I have thought but I think it is true he has a preference for FLA. And, uhm, I don\'t know I\'m just thinking I\'d, I don\'t want to keep being bothered by it to the extent because there is an element of truth in it, even though I know I\'ve always exaggerated it. And it seems I should just be able to accept it. (Pause)And it also I get mad at myself, when I, when I\'m aware of this feeling of jealousy toward FLA because she is favored by my father and, and I\'m seeing it as even more than it really is. And, uhm, and then I, I don\'t know, I think I\'m being I don\'t think I\'m being sour grapes, saying, "Well, I don\'t want any attention from my father anyway now." But, uhm, I don\'t know, I just feel as if I\'ve grown very much apart from him and from the way he sees things. And I don\'t like the kind I think, I don\'t know, I, I can\'t judge if it\'s part of my jealousy or what but I don\'t think I like, I like the relationship that he and FLA has, or maybe I should put it, the kind of relationship it would be necessary to have with him to have him feel the way he does towards FLA. And, and yet I keep being jealous because FLA has these things. (2-minute silence)And I was just thinking after I said that that uhm, it\'s almost as if I want to get what I\'ve always been after from my father just so I could reject it at this point. And, I don\' know, it seems like, to an extent, there\'s something like that that\'s often been part of my relationship with MSCZ. (Pause)Well, our time\'s up.'][[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]dataY[0]: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]Recall: [ 1.          0.98148148  0.          0.          0.        ]
