data x, data y: ["Okay, so that being said, um, yeah, you're a handy car repair person now.What?You're a handy car repair person.Oh, yeah. I'm proud of myself.Um-hum.I, you know, I've been doing, I've been pursuing things, you know, since my husband died, uh for a long time. That's one thing that I'm not. But then, then, okay, though, I was supposed to, my birthday was in January.Uh-huh.So yesterday because my license expired, I thought hey -Yeah, happy birthday last week, huh?Yeah, uh, the [DATE]. Yeah.Um-hum.And so yesterday I go in and I had to take the written test. And I hadn't taken that since [AGE] and I passed.Oh, good.I only missed, and I only missed 4.Congratulations.But those were the new laws so that they switched over for the children.Oh, which new laws for kids? What are the new kid's laws?They keep changing them. Half the police don't even know them. They were asking, one was um, about a, being, if you had just had your license under 3 months and you're 17 years of age, um, it's a weekend and it's 11:00, do you have to have a parental figure or an 18 year old in the car with you while you're driving? And I said yes, because that -Yeah.It, that used to be the law and now it's no.It's not anymore?No.Yeah, it used to be a law for us. So they just got rid of that? So now you can be 17 and you don't need a parent?No, or yeah.Or an 18 year old?No.Well, I guess the idea is -On a weekend. But it was a weekend. It wasn't just on a weekday.Well, the thing is, what if someone is working at McDonalds and they get finished at 11:00.Right. Exactly. So they changed -So how they get home, uh, have their mommy pick them up?Right.[LAUGHING].Exactly.So I bet that they probably got some flack from parents calling their legislators, saying hey, you know that's dumb. I think they were trying to stop people from ganging around, like gangs of high schoolers -I don't blame them.You know, driving around.Well, you know what they have to worry about are the little kids that, you know, that are doing a lot of damage in the neighborhood. And, um, actually they, you know they, I, I caught kids doing this, and I could identify all 3. I called the police. They busted my windshield out of my [INAUDIBLE]. And I thought he did it with his girlfriend.Um-hum.Having a fight.Um-hum.And then I'm pulling in, and they were throwing chunks of snow like, imagine the middle of a snowman. Okay, like that. Two of them were throwing it and trying to hit the windshield as I was pulling in. I was either, if they were on the road, I would have killed them or crashed the car into someone else's car.Um-hum.It would have caused a big accident, and it would have busted the window all the way in. And if there were other kids, my kids, my son just [INAUDIBLE] was a girl. And I called, um, you know, the association, they had a letter and everything. And they didn't even follow through. And they just put up another letter. And I can identify them. I even told them which building they ran in to.Uh-huh. Amazing.Yeah. And the police didn't care. Nobody cares. Oh, we're looking for these people, blah, blah, blah. It's like don't bother to put up the sign if you're not willing to do anything about it. You know? It's ridiculous. I'd, you know, I'm just, I'm kind of really, I've, I've been irritable. I'm disgusted. I, you know, go and, I went to Walmart with my [AGE] neighbor because she doesn't drive very well. And she went to the DMV with me, after the DMV taking that stupid test. [LAUGHING]. We were there like 2 and half hours.Um-hum.And, um, I see people just stealing, and the employees are watching out for them.Really?My sons can't even get a job there. These people -Well, if that happens, if people are stealing, eventually there won't be anything left to steal because the company will go bankrupt.Yes, well, you know, and then, and then, the, they called the employee after this guy has his chinos on, he calls, 2 of the employees were watching out. His wife's loading her purse. He calls the employee. They open up the locked area, you know, for the razor things -Um-hum.And um, he starts loading his pocket. I say something to one of the managers, and they start following me and my old friend around. And I'm like, don't, I don't steal. I told my kids, don't steal. And I said if I ever catch you stealing, I'll go make you work at that store for free -Um-hum.And I don't care what happens. If they arrest you at they make you do something, you know, besides you'll go back to that store and you'll work for them. And I will stand there and I will watch you the whole time.Um-hum.Which would be humiliating.So the management didn't care, or people -They didn't care, and then they -What store is this?It was Walmart.Walmart.Yeah.You should write a letter to corporate headquarters and tell them that.I don't even think they care. I, I, my son -Oh, they will care.No sense in -I mean, you get someone don't care, and then they'll fire the managers. [LAUGHING].Yeah. I, you know, I push my son, you know, to graduate -Because that raises the prices for everyone in some instance.Everybody, yeah.You know, one person should steal like 50 pairs of baby underwear and stuff like that, baby outfits. You know, I said, how old is your baby? Nine months. Do you think your baby cares if they wear the same 2 or 3 outfits every day of the week? Or if they have 50?Yeah.Who are you buying for, because oh, my baby needs clothes. I sit there, you don't need 50.She's lazy and doesn't, she's lazy and doesn't want to do laundry is what it is.[LAUGHING].She's lazy.I like your [INAUDIBLE].A baby at 9 months, by the time they're at 10 months, they're out of that size anyway. You know that and I know that.Um-hum.And any, most people know that, but -And she's just got handfuls of stuff and shove them in her cart, you know.They could go get free stuff, you know? And it's terrible. They are, they could go get used, slightly used stuff and donate their stuff.Right.I always donated my children's clothes, and you know, always to people that need it. You know, and bikes they outgrew, everything. I've always donated, unless it was complete trash, but it, it wasn't. They just went through it so quickly. I just don't get it. You know? I don't get a lot of the things that are happening and it angers me. You know, the unfairness. How they treat certain people -Um-hum.And -Yeah.I just, you know, I clean, I clean a house one day a week, okay? Because I've tried to find a part time job. And look at my hands, okay? I, I work hard.Um-hum.I do, you know, and this isn't part of the job, this is a 3 story, you know, a 3, a 2 stories. I do it. I do the corners, and you know, most maids wouldn't work in the house for that amount of money, and do 12 loads of laundry. And do the stuff that I do. But it's honest work. I'm like, okay, it's helping me till I get a part time job. I'm doing it for one of my friends, and you know, they were paying me, he was paying another maid, 2 maids, more to do it. And I've done it better than them, you know? Even on a, on a rush time. But I spend like 3 days doing it, you know, during the day, you know, when I don't finish up and do, you know, everything. And what happened to honest work?There you go.I don't understand it. I guess that's because I came from a family of 7. And my dad, you know -He relied on you guys to work, too.Pardon?He relied on you guys to work -Yeah.To help support the family.Well, yeah.Well, let's talk about this. You want to get off your Valium, how often you taking it?Um, kind, at first because I wasn't able to sleep, um, about 3 times a day.Um-hum.It has allowed me to sleep the 3 weeks I've been taking it.Um-hum.And calmed me down and focused me to what I was able to do, which is great.Um-hum.Because the Klonopin wasn't doing that. And, um, I just noticed that I -So you're down to 3? Is that what you're taking, 3?Uh-huh.You're taking 3 a day?Two.Two now.Three times a day.You're taking 2 pills 3 times a day?Yeah, I started with 1, and it didn't do anything, and I -So the 10 mg, you're taking 2 of them 3 times a day. So that's 60.Yeah.Uh-huh. That's more than we thought. Okay.I started with 1, and it just didn't, it didn't work. That, that's a medicine that it's like after every 4 hours, it wears off and, but I don't take it all the time. I still have a bunch at home.Are you taking the Provigil still?You know I, I'm thinking that, you know, because I'm really not ADHD -Did they fill it?Oh, they filled that, the 7. Yeah.Did they fill the 30?They didn't fill the 30 yet. No.No. Okay. They may not. Okay.I mean I'm just really so like low on energy, I take that. But then, then you know, I don't sleep.Um-hum.And I have that problem, and that's the worst thing for me because I become so manic and crazy.Are you taking Subutex still?Yes, I am.Okay, 8 mg 4 times a day?Yes.Okay.Now -How about Ritalin? Are you taking that?No.No Ritalin. So you're just taking Valium and Subutex?Right. And since, I, I notice, you know, with the Valium -Um-hum.That my urine smells, but see I had this problem even before then, when I had, when I went to the, um, the urologist. And I still had the, the strep, and he said it's not coming, he went, he catheterized me. And now I'm having a total like problem urinating completely. Um, he said well, your urine is clean. I don't think it is now. It's so thick and it smells so bad.Yeah, you got to get that checked out.And I'm drinking a lot of water. I mean, I've started because I'm going today, otherwise without a little caffeine, and I'm not a coffee drinker, but you know, I've been drinking a lot of water. But it's still, I mean, it's hard for me to urinate, and my back hurts. My, and he told me -Really?Yes.You should go to the ER.He told me after the [DATE], finishing that prescription now, he told me after finishing that prescription -Yeah, you -Take anymore antibiotics.Well, you've got to make sure you don't have a [INAUDIBLE]. If your back hurts maybe the infection is gone up to your kidneys.I don't think it ever went, it, I, it never went away.Yeah. So you need to go, where did you go last time?[DEIDENTIFIED].Well, go somewhere else this time. Um, go like [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.Where, I don't even know where that is. I -Well, [DEIDENTIFIED] is right over here, down [DEIDENTIFIED].Yeah.Okay, they'll take Medicare or Medicaid like that.Yeah.And, uh, you know check yourself in. Go over there now. Just tell them here's the problem. My urine is dark and I've got pain in my back.It smells like it's, it smells worse than poop.Yeah, they'll do a urinalysis and stuff like that. They'll see, you might get admitted for IV antibiotics possibly. You know, or if not, they might give you some oral.I think they should have done that before.Yeah, because you might need that.Because now I'm going, my weight is starting to plunge.Yeah, because that will affect you.And I looked yellow yesterday.Yeah and some of the medicines -Like it's yellow and when I took both the -Okay, yeah, you need to go get checked out and make sure you [INAUDIBLE].Do I look a little yellow to you?Yeah.Yeah.Now as far as the Valium that you're taking, yeah, you need to come down off that because you're taking more than you're supposed to.I don't want to take it period. Do I have to wean off of it?Yeah, otherwise you have a seizure.Why can't I just go on Klonopin?Well, otherwise, well, we could switch you over to Klonopin.Let's go back to Klonopin?Yeah, let's, uh, we're going to change the Valium to Klonopin.Now can Valium -I'm going to say 2 mg 4 times a day -Okay.For the Klonopin.Yeah. Now, and I still have like severe joint pain that's getting worse. And that's not helping. I mean it, I don't get this. I'm not, I'm mot getting why I'm getting up at 1:00 in the morning.Well, strep can cause joint pain, too.Well, they, the RA, it said yes on there, positive -Yeah, you could have rheumatic fever. And that can cause rheumatoid arthritis. It can affect your kidneys and everything.I have to set everything up and it's become, yesterday it was so uncomfortable to walk that it, and I have so much to do that I don't have time to be messing with this. And I've tried. I mean, been going to a doctor once a week, and then him sending me to a urologist. And the urologist not, I said, well, where's the strep coming from. I don't know. Go to a gynecologist. I go, I did. And he told me to go to a doctor. I went to a doctor. He sent me to you. Now you're sending me elsewhere and nobody, you know, I just stopped taking all the antibiotics and I've noticed this is been getting worse and worse.Yeah, you probably need antibiotics intravenously.Yeah.But you need to get checked out. Make sure you're not going on kidney fail, because if you've had all this strep, I mean, you know, you could have acute, um, kidney failure, acute kidney failure.Yeah, and I noticed like yesterday, I looked really yellow. Look at this. I'm starting to look yellow.Um-hum.That started yesterday, and when I put lotion on because I'm really dry. That's, you know, from doing the house.Or it could be hepatitis from other things you've done.I've never shot up.Okay. Well, you can still get -I've never done needles.Hepatitis from some [INAUDIBLE]. You can, it's infectious sometimes.Oh.You can get it through sex or things like that.But I don't -Or even bad food.The only person I've ever been with has been, you know, um, well, I was married to 20 years to the same, same, you know. We had 20 years. I was with the man, married to the man and had my 2 children. I got remarried again, and you know, he did give me HPV. He told me he didn't.Um-hum.You know? Until after he had a break out, you know, 3 weeks after we were married.Now, [PATIENT NAME], I would like, um, to consider something else like Lamictal, Depakote, some of those other things. But first they've got to make sure that you're okay. I can't put you on lithium because your kidneys could be all messed up. So you need to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] now. Okay? It's down [DEIDENTIFIED]. You have a car or something?Yeah.Okay. All right. You just go down [DEIDENTIFIED]. You know where [DEIDENTIFIED] is. Okay, 2 miles down, big hospital there.Okay, so wait. Kind of the way I came?Yeah, park there -Is it by [DEIDENTIFIED]?Well, not [DEIDENTIFIED]. [DEIDENTIFIED] is to the north.Oh, that's the way that I come.[DEIDENTIFIED] is north.I come up [DEIDENTIFIED]. I come up [DEIDENTIFIED] and I go back.Okay, well, okay, [DEIDENTIFIED] -Can you give me like directions?Okay. Well -Write them down because I, I'm good at finding places.Okay, well, um, put it this way. If you, I'll, I'll draw a map for you.I'm not good with [DEIDENTIFIED].That's okay.I got lost down [DEIDENTIFIED], you know?There's a lot of little roads.One of my son's took my money out of my purse.I'll draw this out for you.Just don't do east or west. Just put it right or left. If you just, uh, give me directions.Left down [DEIDENTIFIED].Go the way of McDonalds. Go that way.Just hang on. Hang on. Let me, okay. McDonalds.Okay.There it sits. Um, we are here. Okay? I want you to go -And [DEIDENTIFIED] is right up here, right?Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED] is like here.Okay, yeah. Okay, cool.This is [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay.There's, okay, this is [DEIDENTIFIED]. This is [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay.Okay this little thing is called [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay.And it cuts across, okay? All right? And [DEIDENTIFIED] comes down here. It's otherwise known as [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay, I know exactly.Okay. Okay, you go straight out the driveway. Okay, there's like a funny little concrete thing here.Okay.So you're going to have to like get around it. Okay? But you go this a way. Okay?Okay.So you go like this.Okay.And then make a right turn on [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay.You go down 3 more blocks.Okay.Okay? And you'll get to [DEIDENTIFIED]. Okay?Okay.Okay.And just write [DEIDENTIFIED].Yeah. [DEIDENTIFIED].Thank you.Now there's the big toll way. The toll way comes across like this.Yeah.Okay? You just make a left turn on [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay.Okay, so you go left on [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay.And you go down another mile and you get to the hospital.Okay. And that's called [DEIDENTIFIED]?No, [DEIDENTIFIED].Okay. Put one mile [DEIDENTIFIED]. Yeah, just put one mile.[DEIDENTIFIED].And one, just put one mile and I'll understand.Yeah, one mile.Okay. I got you.Yeah, and it's that way.Right.It's a big building. It's like about 12 stories high or something like that.Do I need a note from you or anything like -No, you just go to the emergency room. Okay? And tell them, here's what's going on. My urine stinks. It smells worse than shit. Okay? [LAUGHING].Okay.I have pain in my back -And front.And front. Okay? Uh, I've been told I have strep. I've been on what, 3 antibiotics.Yeah.Okay. Tell them their names, Cipro, what were you taking? Do you know?Um, I, I have -Flagyl.Some of the stuff. Yeah.Okay, bring them if you've got them. Bring them in.Yeah.Say I've taken antibiotics. It's not getting better. You know, my psychiatrist says I probably need IV antibiotics.Yeah.Okay and I got -And I said I'm turning yellow.I'd say, yeah, I'm turning yellow, and I got joint pains.Yeah.Tell them that.Okay.And they'll go, oh, okay. [LAUGHING].Okay, yeah, because at [DEIDENTIFIED] they won't do it because it, once they know that I'm on this medicine right here -What, Subutex?They think it's a joke.They freak out.Right. Exactly.Oh.So, but that becomes a problem. They don't, then they don't listen to me. They think that I'm out for something and I'm not.Say your not there for pain stuff. You're there to admitted, to get an IV antibiotics.Someway, yeah, so I can get rid of this finally. I've been trying, I tried, you know, way over a year to get rid of it, like -Oh, yeah. I'll write something. Pyelonephritis.You don't think I should put this off at all though? I have a lot to do today.Go now and get checked -Okay.Because otherwise, you know, things can get worse.Okay. Well, it has been getting worse for a long time.Yeah, and so it's best to get checked.Okay.Then I will see you back in one week.Okay.All right, so we'll make the appointment.Do you go to this, do you practice there?I don't go to [DEIDENTIFIED]. No, I don't. I used to go long ago, but I don't now.Okay. If they, I mean, admit me, would they just, would I just, they'd let me out. Give me antibiotics and let me out?Well, it all depends.", 'And thanks very much.You\'re welcome.So I think your strategy for programming the phone is brilliant to remind you about appointments.Oh, my God. I, look at this. It\'s an encyclopedia.Not at all. Actually -Really?Yours is one of the thinner ones for someone who\'s been here as long. Lots of other people\'s have been thinned down -Oh yeah.So they can put on microfilm, so. No, this isn\'t bad at all.No.And it has to do with the agency generates paperwork. I mean, as you know, there\'s so much oversight now of medicine and especially mental health, and some of the problems locally, and so there\'s a lot. To me it\'s repetitive. Sometimes I\'ll fill out what seems like the same form three or four times for the same visit. But, you know, hopefully it\'s helping somewhere. But don\'t, don\'t think that the paper means anything. Don\'t worry about that. So well, how have you been?Okay.Yeah.Since my cat died, I\'m just not the same really.I was thinking of you recently. My cat got diagnosed with severe hyperthyroidism.Oh, my.She had lost a lot weight, um, and she needs to start taking medication. Um, so sometimes they do develop a condition pretty quickly. And, uh, yours, I think, had like a dental abscess or problem, right?Yeah.It\'s hard.And I spent all that money getting teeth cleaned and getting everything.Yeah.I don\'t think he did a, the job right, because he kept pushing this tooth. It was still -Oh.Infected. I think she died from that. I do.Oh.And it broke in half. I miss her. And my other cat is, like, lost.Yeah.So and it\'s depressing me.Would you consider a new addition to the family? There\'s nothing like a kitten to perk everybody up.I know. I don\'t know how he\'d react. And I\'d hate to make the commitment and then have to, you know, I know instantly I\'d fall in love with a kitten.Yeah.So I don\'t want to make the commitment, and then he\'s not happy, and then have to -I wonder if there\'s a setting where you could test drive? You know, like if there is, like if there were a situation where somebody -I do know a lot of people -Might have them up for adoption, and maybe they could bring it over and see how they do.I do know a lot of people that are in [DEIDENTIFIED] and -Yeah.[NAME OTHER] is such an animal lover.And I can see why. You know, you want to be fair to the cat that\'s left. But the cat that\'s left, may feel kind of like how you do, like, "Oh, I miss the company," you know.He, oh, he definitely does.Not that anybody fills the shoes, but you know.Because he\'s always looking at my, my roommate\'s room.Ah.Because she was always in his room.They\'re so cute.And I\'ll go, "Oh, I love you," and he\'ll be looking like, "Is she coming?"Ah.Still.Yeah.This article was amazing I was reading about how they know how they really feel, and they have humor, and they have this. And they took, they didn\'t really explain it, they just told some areas and said, "You decide." And they were amazing. And my cat is funny. I was thinking about, just last week, he was real, he was, I don\'t know, uh, he did something and I, I didn\'t want him to do it. And I\'m like, "No." And I never yell at him. And I really yelled at him. He was just getting on my nerves. He was just, I was irritable. And when I went near him, he slapped me. [LAUGHING].Isn\'t that amazing how they sometimes will do that?He slapped me.[LAUGHING].I\'m like, "Oh, my God. He slapped me." [LAUGHING]. I went by and, like, shhsh. I\'m like, I never yell at him, you know, he\'s usually all sweet and cuddly.Oh.He slapped me. And it reminded me that months before, when she was alive, he did that one time, too.Wow.I went walked, um, by him after yelling at them, after yelling at both of them. And he slapped me, and I -Wow.I whacked him back.He told you what he thought about that.Isn\'t that funny?Wow.I\'m like, "Oh, my God."Wow.Because I yell, really yell, I\'m, I never yell. But I was loud. [LAUGHING]. And then I walked by him, he goes shhsh.[LAUGHING].He told me what he thought. [LAUGHING].You know, they\'re amazing.They are amazing.Well since you have friends in [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, I bet there\'s someone who\'s willing to bring one over, and just see how they do. You know?Yeah.And it takes pressure off you, too, to say, "You know, if it\'s not this one, we\'ll probably find another one." You know, from somewhere. You know, this is the right way to go about it.Because he was like running, and hopping and skipping and stuff before. Now he\'s just laying like an old cat.Ah.I\'m sad. He\'s the one with the crooked neck.Ah.So he, he\'s a little mental, I mean, he really is, but he\'s such a love fuzz ball.Ah. They\'re such good company. I have a friend whose dogs, um, she live down in Texas, her dogs got loose, and um, got into a chicken coop.Ah.And a farmer shot them both.Oh, my God.One died. The other one survived. It\'s been a difficult course. But she just got a puppy and they both just really brightened up.Oh good.So, you know, the new dog was, uh, the older dog was very receptive to, you know, it\'s like the cheerfulness of having a baby around when, you know, someone in the family has died, or whatever. But, you know, you could probably test drive. [LAUGHING]. You know?Yeah.Because I can tell there\'s something missing. Yeah. I can tell you feel -It\'s so true.Down.It\'s weird. It really, I always have just one of my legs going the one way, I mean, it, I just, you know.Yeah.It\'s weird, and he\'s not the same, either.Yeah. And that\'s so sad. Yeah.Now, um, [NAME OTHER] on Thursday, my boyfriend, he went out and there was a cat walking around, and it ended up, and it was knocking into things.Ah.Found out the cat was blind.Oh, poor baby.And he left food out for it, and the neighbor, finally they found the cat and put a note on his door, "Thanks for the food," because otherwise he probably -Ah.Who knows if he would have hung around or whatever.Yeah.But he said, he was telling me, "It\'s walking into things."Poor baby.It just couldn\'t see. And you know how usually -Ah.You, your, an animal will look up at you. It didn\'t.Oh.It was so sad.He might be deaf, too. I don\'t know, if he didn\'t respond to noise.No. Because he was following noise.Oh. Okay.He was following the noise.So it can at least do that.But anyway, the owners found him, she said she was crying. He told me she was crying.Oh. Good. Well I\'m glad somebody is taking care of him. Do you ever watch the Cold Case series?Yeah. I do.Yeah. Don\'t you love the cats?Yeah.I love the cats.[LAUGHING].Tripod and Cyclops. [LAUGHING]. That\'s what one boyfriend called them. He didn\'t last long.So the studies, like just about, do you just talk normal about stuff, or?Exactly.Oh, okay.And then, you know, they would, they would, you know, give feedback, possibly about, you know, it might have been possible to ask more in this area about depression, or whatever. Or follow up on such and such, you know, but, uh -Well -But they cannot release the information to anybody else at all.Okay. Well, you know, I have been a little, feeling a lot more depressed lately. I don\'t if it\'s because of what\'s, uh, it\'s since it happened. And I wonder if, you know, my medicine needs to be adjusted or, I mean, it\'s been this way for a long time.You might want to talk about that. Exactly. Exactly.And I\'ve really, I\'ve been, I mean, today I did get dressed and did my hair and make-up, but it\'s, some days I\'m like, "Oh, I don\'t even care." I, I mean I just throw stuff on, and I\'m usually not like that.Yeah.So it\'s just like this past 6 months have not been that great mentally for me.Do you ever feel like there\'s sort of a seasonal piece to it, too? Like you\'re usually more down in the winter, or at the change of seasons, or it could be any time?Randomly, honestly.Yeah.Like it was really, winter I was, yeah. And I think maybe because of her, and I felt so bad. I look at him and he\'s not the same. And, it, really, I don\'t know why, I\'ve been, I\'ve been not the same.Yeah. And this could be more severe than some other bereavement that you\'ve had. Because you\'ve lost two pets before, right. And this one seems like it\'s really get, hard to, you know, I\'m saying move on with the bereavement process.Because -Not that you get over -She was young.Yeah.Well not young, but, you know, animals usually live 16, 17, and like that. She was only 10. And I thought there was at least six, seven more years. It\'s the youngest -Yeah.And she wasn\'t sickly. Well she wasn\'t real, real healthy, but she wasn\'t sick. And so she was, like, very nervous until she was with me about year.Yeah.But she, then she knew she was loved.Yeah.And she really calmed down. And, well sh -And it sounds like she had a pretty good 10 years. That\'s a pretty good track records. But -While she dying then she stayed in my bed -Ah.Day and night, night and day, until she did not leave on. I fed her there. She was sick.Ah. She had a bad infection, it sounds like. Just a very, maybe more widespread than the doctor recognized initially. I don\'t know.I don\'t know.That\'s sad.It\'s, the sad thing to me is, uh, I, I don\'t, I don\'t know if it could have been avoided. I don\'t know. I don\'t even want to think about it. It\'s go, let\'s go on.I think you did everything you could. It sounds like that. You know?I did.Everything that a person knows how to do. But, yeah, I am hearing that this is really hanging over you. Yeah. Um -I feel like the depression is so bad.Yeah.For a while it was just like, fine, and that lately, since this happened, it\'s like, the stress, I don\'t know what, but I just, I don\'t, I don\'t know, I\'m thinking even medicine, uh -Yeah. I think maybe at least the medicine that you\'re taking, those are pretty robust doses. But -Now, the Wellbutrin, I haven\'t been taking the extra, just the 200.Okay.Because he gave me the 100s, and they\'re, like, a horrible color, and I don\'t -[LAUGHING].They\'re like a brownish-orange, and I\'m thinking that\'s got to be some kind of dangerous dye, or something.Oh. I\'m so glad that you said something. I had no idea.They\'re horrible. Yeah.And different generic manufacturers will sometimes manufacture different, you know, a different color, whatever. Uh, well I was thinking anyway, given that you\'re on the Zoloft at 200, um, and the Wellbutrin, it\'s the sustained release, you\'ve been taking 300 for a long time, and now I know you didn\'t add the 100 -Yeah.So at least you told me. And that\'s been a while.I know, because -Because I suggested adding that a while ago.Every time he gave it to me, I\'m like, "Ew, I\'m not taking that." [LAUGHING].Oh. Oh I wish you\'d told me sooner.I know.But, um, what\'s worth doing anyway, [PATIENT NAME], is changing from the SR to the XL. I was just talking with somebody else about this. It\'s generic now, so it should be just as inexpensive, I hope. Um, and it\'s a more extended release. It\'s a smaller pill. To my knowledge, they\'re always white, for one thing, dye free.[LAUGHING].Um, and um, with that, you can take two or three of the 150s a day. Because it\'s longer extended release, there\'s less risk of lowering the seizure threshold, which was one of the original concerns about the short-acting Wellbutrin. So people will sometimes take 450. And with the SR, I had suggested going up to 400, which was thought to be more or less the maximal dose of that. But if I wrote for the XL for you what you could do is, I could write for three a day, and then you could start with two, and then you can see. Because Wellbutrin XL 300 do better by me than -Oh.The SR 150, which might have been metabolized faster by your system, or out of your system faster. If you say, "Well, it\'s more of the same," then you could just add the third. And you don\'t have to pay for an extra prescription, or additional pill, or anything.That\'s funny, because I have noticed from day to day, like when I, I feel really, and then I\'ll take the pill, it does lift me up a little bit. I -Yeah.So I didn\'t realize it wore off that quickly, but, uh -It, with your particular metabolism it might. Yeah.Okay.And even with the XL, you could take that twice a day, still.Oh, okay.You know, if you\'re, if you might be someone who someone who -Well the other one I took it in the morning, because if I took it, I, in, later on I couldn\'t sleep from it.Exactly. Exactly. It\'s finding that balance with where it\'s helping give some energy and possibly, like if you have concerns with focus and concentration, you know, if it\'s helping with that, as well, um, but not interfering with your sleep.Okay.So yeah. Why don\'t we try the XLs, up to three a day. And that way you don\'t have to worry about adding another ugly, [LAUGHING], since the third one might something unpalatable.Oh, it\'s purplish brown.You\'re kidding. I wonder why they do that?I don\'t know, but I s, I had actually two bottles of it I should, if you want me to bring it in.Oh, yeah.You could give it to someone.I can always find a home for them, because I mean, I do, uh -I\'ll definitely bring them in, because the -Wow.I know they\'re expensive.Wow.And they\'re ug, and I\'m like, "I\'m not taking this." [LAUGHING].That\'s too bad. I have never heard that report.I\'ll have to bring them in. I\'ll bring them, I\'ll give you -Wow.Next time I have to remember. I\'ll probably put it in my phone.Well it\'s really helpful to hear, too. Because, you know, unless I have direct experience, I wouldn\'t even know. But that that could be a turn-off to somebody, it\'s important to know.You know all those dyes and stuff you hear the stuff.Sure.You know I haven\'t been ar, I don\'t know.Yeah.I\'m like, "I don\'t want to take" -I hadn\'t thought about that.[LAUGHING].Yeah. Okay.I thought, you know, I take enough pills, I don\'t want to have to take dyes, too.Sure. Exactly. And what\'s nice about the XL, is, you know, if you want to add the third, you can add the third, you know, that\'s an approved dose. But you may get more mileage just out of the two every day. And that way you get a little extra from every prescription -Yeah.To tide you over, and that\'s okay, too. So does, do you feel comfortable starting there. I have other ideas, too, with what we could add, if we, you know, if it\'s, uh -No.That doesn\'t pan out.I wouldn\'t mind trying that. Actually, I, I feel safer with the same medicine, than to start something new.I know that historically, yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds like the way to go for now. Absolutely.Yeah. Try that, because I, I have been feeling down, and I\'m like, "This isn\'t right. I shouldn\'t feel this down."It\'s a more complicated bereavement.And getting out of bed, and -You are grieving, but there\'s some strong elements of the depression recurring, too. Yeah. All right. Well we\'ll just, uh -There isn\'t any time, I mean, I\'ve been on this medicine a long time.Yeah. Yeah.This is like the worst -And you and I have worked together for a long time.Yeah.And I haven\'t seen you this down in a very, very long time.No.So there are brighter days ahead. You\'re always going to miss the one you lost. Um, but you\'ll cherish that memory and you\'ll find new ones to love, and, that you, especially something so unexpected, that take a lot of getting used to.Yeah. I didn\'t think she was going to die.Yeah.She\'s, uh, sweet. She\'s so sweet.She had a good life, huh? I think, you know -Yeah.The part of her life with you is better than most cats ever dream of. [LAUGHING].That\'s true. I think that to myself.Yeah.I\'ll be like, and I think, "Oh, but I could have been, done better." Because [INAUDIBLE] demanded the attention, and it took away from her. But she was happy. She was.I bet she loved watching you two, also.Um-hum.You know, that\'s the funny thing, too. Cats have a certain spectator ness about them, so even if you were paying attention to the other one, they say, "Well that\'s really interesting."She would come in, we\'d go and, and, like, uh, pounce on her.[LAUGHING].I\'m like, "Get off of her." Because he\'s like twice her size. I\'m like, "Get off of her."Was he a little jealous?Very jealous.Yeah. Rival for your affection.But she, she squeaked. She went, "Rrrr." Like that.Oh, they\'re so, I love it when they talk.So I, I, I go, "Get off of her." And then a co, a co, you know what, she would a lot of times play me, because she would start with him and didn\'t think I\'d see.[LAUGHING].And then look at me crying, so I would yell at him.Yeah. Yes. That\'s good parenting training, you know. [LAUGHING].So funny. So funny. I\'m like, "You know what? You\'re playing me, girlfriend." That\'s what I\'m saying to my, she\'d start it, and she didn\'t think I see. And then she\'d look at me like, "Look, look what he\'s doing." [LAUGHING].They are amazing.They are amazing.Mine can just be, uh, looking like she\'s napping on the counter, and then I\'ll go to walk by, and she\'ll stick out her paw.[LAUGHING].Like, "What\'s the password?" You know, like, uh, "You\'re not going to get away without paying attention to me. Even if I\'m sleeping, I want you to pay attention to me."Oh, aren\'t they something else?Really funny.Aren\'t they something else?They\'re a hoot.You know it\'s bad when they start slapping you back.Oh, that is, I have to admit -I just yelled, I mean, I didn\'t hit him.That\'s a little unusual.He slapped me.[LAUGHING].I\'m like, "You slapped me." I went by him after I yelled at him, he went shhsh. [LAUGHING]. They\'re amazing.That is a hoot.Now in this, uh, magazine in the, in the office, I mean in the waiting room, there\'s a man in there telling these stories about animals. What they do with the cops, and, uh -Yeah.Just amazing things. And they said, "Do they think?" And do they, you know, they\'re so much like us, we don\'t even realize.Oh, they, they\'re probably a lot smarter than people are.[INAUDIBLE].I mean, who caused pollution, you know? Probably not animals. [LAUGHING].You know it. And then, [COUGHING], they said a story about this pig that, uh, it\'s job helping, um, helping, um, handicapped children or something.Oh, wow.Run all the way to get to his work one morning -Oh.And then, in there they said that after that he could never eat pig, which was his favorite meat, from reading that.Ah, yeah.He said that was his favorite meat, but after he saw that.I can understand that.I could see becoming vegetarian. You know that I would, but I\'d really miss the chicken and poultry, I mean, chicken and fish.Yeah.I can see it.Yeah. I can certainly understand that, too. So I\'ll be writing for the Wellbutrin XL three daily. All right, start with two, just see. Maybe this sits better, make sure your sleep is okay. So forth and so on. You know, if you feel like you need the additional, it\'s there. If not, you\'re just a little bit ahead for next month.Okay.Do you want to make a follow up appointment for the usual time?Yeah.Yeah. And then if you decide you want to come back sooner, just call [NAME OTHER]. It\'s all right, we\'ve got some room to work with. So that\'s good. All right. Look those over. See if it makes, makes sense. I want to get your pharmacist\'s attention that it\'s not the exact same thing.Oh, yeah.Yeah.That, what\'s this last one mg? Xanax, is that\'s 30, not 60?Yeah. Should it be 60?Yeah.Oh, okay.Dispense.[INAUDIBLE] take twice a day. All right, got you.Wellbutrin Extended -Oh, that\'s right. Yep, as of the beginning of the year, that\'s right. Thank you.[INAUDIBLE]. Take that daily. Hopefully, I\'ll have to remember to bring in those other ones, because they\'re sitting there. And I heard someone say their prescriptions are like over $100.They can be sometimes. Even for generics if the person doesn\'t have, um, you know, a payment plan or coverage. Yeah. So you know, I do recycle medications. Even samples where a place that I work are throwing them out, because they consider them expired, you know, when it gets that month. You know, and if people say they can\'t get their medication, I\'ll say, you know, "This one is about to go." You know, in, and, it\'s available. You know, I think if you keep them in a cool, dry place they stay good for a while. Um, so sometimes people make that option.These aren\'t even that old.Yeah. Yeah.When they were normal, I, I took them. And then they stopped being normal, and I stopped taking them.Which must mean that your, um, pharmacy changed generic manufacturers.[LAUGHING].It\'s really strange. One time, um, I should actually tell you since you\'re on, uh, generic Zoloft. One time I had a patient who really noticed a big difference between one kind of generic Zoloft and another kind.Oh.And she remembered when and where she got the one that worked better. But, of course, it didn\'t stick on her mind what was the name of the company. Whoever looks at that anyway.Yeah.But sometimes it\'s on the bottle, but unless you happen to keep the bottle. It turned out that it was actually her prescription coverage company that was able to track down the one that was good, and then find another pharmacy that had that same kind now, that was close to where she lived -Oh.Which was amazing. Because I think her pharmacy changed -Oh.Providers as well, and then she just said, "It just doesn\'t work as well." You know, and generics can vary by as much as 20% from the original in terms of potency. So it could be 20% more or 20% less than the original brand, and then if you\'re changing generics, that could mean a 40% difference, if you went from one that was 20% less to one that was 20% more than the original.So, it\'s, could be, actually leg, 20% off of what -Stronger or less than the brand had been. Yeah.Oh, man. Generics? All generics?Yeah.Wow.Yeah. So I do think, though, for good business practices they try to get it as close as possible to the original brand name, but I guess some, uh, some are easier, some types of chemicals are easier to do that with than others, or some types of molecules.[INAUDIBLE] costs and everything?Yeah. And, actually believe it or not, the other one I hear it the most about is Wellbutrin, bupropion, or Budeprion. But there can be a big variability.Oh.So it certainly is, looking at, you know, what you, the generic extended release that your pharmacy carries -Oh, okay.It may just go a, a lot more of a long way than the SR. So.And he changed, so maybe he stocks it different too.Yeah. Exactly.Well the other ones were white, but he, I do, think my Zoloft was changed to generic.Yeah.It was blue, and now it\'s tan. He did change it, my Zoloft.Yeah.Oh, wow. I didn\'t even think about that.Yeah. So maybe, you know, once we, once we are in a -We\'ll see which is which.Wellbutrin situation, we can also look at the Zoloft situation, and see if that\'s, you know.Oh, wow. I would never have even thought that in a million years.Yeah.He did change it. Oh, wow. And it does, see it really does affect you.Yeah.I thought it was me. I thought it was -Oh, it can make a difference.Really depressed.Yeah, because I definitely ran across that with another patient.Well that\'s, I, I wouldn\'t have even thought of that. You know, I think that they\'re the same, but, wow, that\'s something else.Yeah. So -It\'s totally different now.Yeah.Now, it was 10, but they are like, more oblong looking now than they were before.Yeah.Oh, wow.It\'s got to be a different generic. Yeah. And some of them are round. Some of the Zolofts I know are round. Yeah.Wow. I should ask the, I wonder if that was since December?That\'s worth looking at, too.Because I know, I mean, after that happened with her, it got me in a depression, but I haven\'t really come out of it.Yeah.I mean, I, I function, I do what I have to, but not where I have days where I feel good, because I don\'t.Right.Wow.And if the brand changed, you know, well you might not be getting the support you were used to getting from your medication. It\'s a possibility.Wow.Yeah.Okay.All right. So we\'ve got some things we can follow up on then.Yeah. That\'s good. That\'s good.Yeah. Try to get back to some -I knew I had to speak to you about this, because I -Yeah. I\'m glad. I\'m really glad you made it in.I really wasn\'t feeling like myself.Yeah.And for me, usually I, I\'m aware, even though she doesn\'t call me. Like if she doesn\'t here and there, I still make it. This is the first time I\'ve really missed. Ever.Yeah. Oh, and it\'s not counting against you or anything.No, I know. [LAUGHING].You\'re, you\'re a good, you know, um -But, I think that, I don\'t know, I, I called her. I went, "Do I have an appointment today?" I just totally, usually I -It was in the back of your mind. Yeah.It was like 15 minutes before I was to show, I\'m like, "You know, I\'m going to have to reschedule."Well now you\'re smart to put it into your phone. Yeah. I\'m glad you came when you did. You know I appreciate it, it\'s, you know, it\'s the last part of the day, we took a little bit of extra time. I\'m glad we had it -Yeah.Because, you know, I think we needed to get into some real detail on this, but I appreciate you being very patient about that. Yeah.Yes. Um-hum.All right. Well thanks again for participating. I\'ll let you know what results I might be able to share, and -Are there results? [LAUGHING].Yeah. I think they\'re going to have, you know, like, feedback about communication and whatever, so, yeah.Well I\'d kind of like to know, it would be interesting.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you, there\'s also a, and I\'m sure, if you ever want to participate, it\'s totally up to you. And you can even decide later. If you wanted to participate in the follow-up study. Like sometimes they\'ll pay. You know, maybe one area I can tell you of, of interest, especially to pharmaceutical companies, is treatment-resistant depression. You know, where someone is, you know, they\'ve been treated for a while. Maybe their medication isn\'t working as well, or if they need to make a change or add something. So -I would definitely do one of them.Yeah. There\'s a place here where you can put your contact info.Okay.Yeah. Right there, it says "Additionally," by checking this box, then you could, uh, contact with additional questions and if you choose to participate in follow up meetings, you would be paid a fee in connection with, um, the study. So -Okay.Yeah. If you would prefer e-mail or telephone, you can put that information down.Okay.Sometimes a source of a little extra income is helpful.Very helpful.Yeah. Good.Very.Ah. Okay.All right. Thank you.So -I, I\'m sorry about missing the appointment.Oh, I\'m glad you made it. The important thing is, you know, and, and this way we got a little extra time.It was very needed.And it sounds like we probably needed it actually.I had to come and see -Yeah.I was just, this was really, had me worried, because I had [INAUDIBLE], so.Yeah.And I never related it to him changing that medicine.It\'s pos, that could be a part of the picture, you know?And it\'s got to be some of it, anyway.It could be a piece of the puzzle.Well, I\'m really glad you, that I could see you.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and it\'s really because patients tell me that I know there is a difference, you know.But I didn\'t really, it\'s, it\'s, I\'m glad you told me because I didn\'t associate it like that. I think generics are, they have to be this, they have to be that, they can\'t be that far off.And most of the time they are pretty close, but a few I\'ve been hearing, and you know, and in my particular field, there can be big differences.He\'s, he changes a lot, too, different medicines.And he\'s probably just trying to -And just wonder if -Yeah, for the economy, and another generic manufacturer comes along and says, "Hey, I\'ll sell you for, you know, $5 less a month," or whatever.I mean for, like, um, simvastatin also.Yeah.He\'s changing it a lot, a lot. And then he gave me the one, one time, I, every time I took it, I thought I was going to pass out.Wow.I told my doctor, he said just stop taking it.Yeah. There might have been some ingredient that just didn\'t agree with you, or -Well on the commercial it says if weakness or, it could be stop, discontinue.Yeah.It was weird. I\'m like, "What\'s wrong with me? Is it my blood sugar or something?" But I stopped taking it, and it went away.I\'m glad you talked to your doctor about it. Yeah, anything that doesn\'t seem right, you know, we can get to the bottom of.Horrible. Like I broke out in a sweat, and I just felt like I was going to faint.Huh.I\'m thinking, you know, and, you know, I -You reacted to something.Yeah. Huh. Okay. Thank you.Oh, it\'s good to see you. Brighter days ahead.I hope.Yeah.Is it just? Okay.Yeah, you can leave that for [NAME OTHER] if you want her to contact you, or give her a call.Okay.Yeah, either way.All right. Thank you.Okay. Good to see you. [INAUDIBLE].You too. Bye-bye.Bye-bye.', 'Hi, Johnny.You\'re always beating me. One of these times I\'m going to sprint up and beat you.(Chuckling). Well, you see I time it all when I hear the door opening.You\'ve got to give that little, you know, 11247...Oh, I did that before you came.Oh, wow. You\'re no fatter, I guess.Huh?I say you\'re no fatter.What do you mean?That\'s scary.No, no fatter, but fat. How about you?Well, I had a really interesting weekend; it was really - it was kind of different, you know. You ever have these like old family albums, all that sort of thing?Um-hmm. Like the old pictures?Yeah, yeah, that\'s what I... I had a thing, you know. I kind of said when I left for the weekend that I didn\'t really know if I wanted to go.Yes.And went away anyhow. And I kind of went with the idea, you know, finding out a little bit about, like, my family background, which I really have never done. It\'s kind of like if you\'ve been home from your family for a while then you kind of - well, I\'ve been gone, I guess I left around, say, junior year, so it\'s been, gosh, 12 years, and I\'m to a point now where I can kind of look back on things. But I asked my ma a whole lot of questions about like when she was a little girl and when her mother was a little girl and when - well, that\'s as far back as I could go because I don\'t remember back any further. See, there\'s this thing, this is what I was trying to figure out, like. I never found out about my dad; like I said before, that he was a taboo subject now. 0:02:39.3You\'ve never spoken about him at home.Right, right. Never mentioned him except for once; and that was the time we were drinking and then we got to it. And I asked my ma all sorts of questions about whether they were an emotional kind of family at home and like if she was - like if my grandfather would ever hold her in her (sic) lap and who she\'d talk to when something was bothering her and all this sorts of stuff. I think for one evening or it was one afternoon I was talking to her about three, four hours, you know, just kept after her. And then I got hints and inklings; like, I didn\'t ask directly. My father came up, but I got hints and inklings along the way. And then on the last morning I was there - I left on a Saturday because I - last morning, I had asked the day before if she had any old albums and stuff, and she kept two albums from the time that she dated my father. And a long time ago I must have glanced through a bit. It was kind of like glancing through something like maybe a Playboy when I was in high school; something I didn\'t really study. And if I\'d see her looking at them, looking through these things, then I would close them, pretend like I was just looking at old pictures.Then my real curiosity was on my father, and this time, though, I still felt funny, like I almost had to work up to ask her about - let\'s see what it was - to ask her about if he had any letters; that\'s what I was after was the letters. 0:04:27.9Letters that he wrote to her?Yeah. Or any letter, anything he wrote, anything where his personality would come through. But finally I asked her if she had any and...(Telephone ringing)(Answering call) Hello? Hi. Yeah, but I\'m seeing somebody. Yeah. I\'ll be psychodrama meeting tonight. Yeah, I\'ll give you a call or something. Okay.Well, I asked her about the letters, and she had saved them all but then she threw them all away except for the last one he wrote so I didn\'t have really anything there. And it was kind of - when I first asked her about that then she - I said something like, you know, "Never really talked about it." Now I\'m really curious about him, and it stuck kind of funny, like, what do I call him? You know, I refer to him obliquely; I don\'t refer to him like my father. She refers to him as either "your father" or "Johny"; his name is the same as mine. But me, I feel strange when I refer to him, even. But anyhow, I went through these books. She made one comment, like before I\'d been talking, and it just came out kind of - well, it just came out. One comment was that - how did she say it? Oh, I was after the [funny knot] (ph), you know, like whether we were really warm, we were a warm family, or an emotional family or anything like this, that\'s what I was digging at. And then I said, you know, "Was my father a warm person," and she said, yeah, he was a lot different than she was. And then she said something, you know, that really zonked me, because whether or not she believes it, it must have been her attitude. 0:06:54.8Hope it\'s not.And she said, one statement, how did she say it? When we were at home it was considered - did she use the word "affectionate"? I think she said, "When we were at home it was considered a sin to show affection, to touch."Now, wait a minute. She\'s talking about in her home, when she was...Yeah, yeah, when she was back on the farm. And she says, "When we were at home it was considered a sin." I used the word "affectionate." I says, "Was there much affection," and she says, "Yeah, when she was at home it was considered a sin. Now, I think that - and like touch, hugging, stuff like that, especially like with a guy or something in a sexual sense, and she said when she told that to my father he couldn\'t understand that. He says he just couldn\'t understand it. So one time my father and my mother - I don\'t know if this was before or after they were married - they were over at my grandmother\'s house, that would be my mother\'s mother, and my dad put his arm around my mother and said something silly like, you know, "Look it, you know, I\'ve got my arm around your daughter, you know, something like this. 0:08:32.3Yes.But, you know, that\'s really subtle. And my impression of my dad is like he was really a stud. All the pictures are like one of these - oh, for instance, there was a quote, the only thing I could find that he had written. There are only two things I\'ve ever read that he had written. (Inaudible at 0:09:03.6) a little quote from the newspaper; I don\'t know if it\'s factual, and he had just - I didn\'t realize but he had been - I knew he was a boxer, but he was a champion of the division and then he had been in golden gloves competition. And one was from - he lost a quarter finals round in Kansas City. So they have this quote in there... What did he say? Oh, the guy is in the room and he is asking him, you know, "Why did you lose the fight?" And he says, "Well," he says, "I\'ve got such a good record that any time it goes to a decision I naturally lose," you know, some cocky statement like that. And there\'s another thing my ma said: That my dad always said that he did not deserve her. So I don\'t know if maybe it was just he was cocky on the outside and underneath, you know, maybe that\'s projecting from me...Yeah, but that seems hard to interpret what that means, huh? 0:10:04.9Yeah, yeah. You know, like all weekend long I was trying to - you know, I was trying to get at things that I haven\'t ever asked about before. There was another thing... What did she say? It was about sentimentality. Oh yeah. When we were going to my sister\'s in-laws, that is where we had our Thanksgiving dinner, and apparently last year, when they had the dinner, it would be my sister\'s father-in-law - his name was Wes - and he\'s a real warm kind of open, real, you know, kind of sentimental type guy. He\'s really nice, at least I think he is. And my ma likes him, too, but he opens the - he has a spontaneous prayer for the Thanksgiving dinner, and his daughter and her husband are in the Peace Corps and they\'re over in Malaysia, someplace in Malaysia, or Indonesia it is.And last year, apparently, he had a prayer saying, you know, remember them over there, working hard, you know, in a certain new country and all this. And, oh, he mentioned protect me going back to New York and all this kind of - you know, it\'s kind of sentimental stuff, slushy stuff.Yeah.And my ma gets very - she doesn\'t like this at all and she says, "I hope, you know, he doesn\'t have some - something slushy like that," you know, sentimental stuff. And it\'s kind of funny with me too, because like when I\'ve noticed that like when you sing happy birthday to somebody, I\'ll sing it, but I feel kind of stupid doing it, you know, kind of, oh, I don\'t know. Or there are other things that I think I pick that up, too.What do you mean?This kind of uncomfortableness with, let\'s say, sentimental or even close sorts of things. 0:12:40.8Sounds like a sign that that kind of stuff isn\'t rational enough; it\'s too emotional or too childlike, not adult.Yes, it\'s something like that. It\'s even feeling embarrassed by that sort of thing, you know, and my ma kind of - well, she put it into words, but I sometimes (inaudible at 0:13:12.3) myself. You know, the thing with it is like - oh, there\'s one other thing. I asked her specifically - she thought, you know - I didn\'t tell her I was in therapy, but she kind of - after I\'d been drilling her for a couple of hours she started saying stuff like, you know, "Don\'t you think I did a good job bringing you up or something? Why are you asking me all of these questions," you know. And oh, she says, "Do you think I\'m crazy," or something like that. I said, "No, I think you\'re probably normally neurotic," whatever that means, you know, I says, because there are certain things I\'ve told her, and I tried to explain. I says, "Ma, there are certain times..." You know, like she wanted to be a nurse, even a practical nurse. I said, "Now, I have tried a thousand times to sit down and explain it to you, but you don\'t hear that, you don\'t want to hear that, because you\'re afraid to be a nurse," you know.You tried to sit down and tell her what?I tried to tell her like what she could do to become a practical nurse.Oh, uh-huh, how to go about it.Yeah. One of the things, she\'d have to risk herself in a classroom. And I tried to explain the difference between intelligence, raw intelligence, and the amount of time you spend in the classroom. She thinks that you\'re intelligent if you go through high school and college, then you\'re really smart, you know, whereas she\'s dumb because she only went through 10th grade. I says, you know, "It doesn\'t necessarily mean that." But she doesn\'t hear that. And I went through about four things, trying to say...She doesn\'t have concrete evidence for herself that she\'s intelligent.Yeah, right, right, right. The way she measures it is that way.And no matter how much you try to tell her differently, you can\'t get through to her.Right. Well, the reason I cited all these things, I says, "These have been times when I\'ve tried to explain something to you, and I say you\'re normally neurotic because you cannot know what I am saying, because you don\'t want to know what I\'m saying," and so I don\'t know. I don\'t think I left her thinking she was crazy but... Well, then I cited one other thing, and this she taught me something. There was this time, I think I mentioned it to you, when I was about in 1950 or \'51, when I was real small and my cousin was going away to war. And my mother, my mother\'s boyfriend, the cousin that was going away and I were all in my aunt\'s living room; everybody else had left the room. And she went after my cousin in a nice sort of way. You know, this is another thing that came over occurred (ph). In a nice sort of way she says, "Well, tomorrow night you\'ll be on the boat, you\'ll be going off to war, you know, I went through all that," and just I think the kid was shattered, by the end and crying. And my mother\'s boyfriend just mentioned a little that she shouldn\'t have said that. 0:16:25.7 I perceived it, and I still remember it and I brought this up, and I says, you know, "This is an instance where I don\'t think you knew what you were doing." And then she said, "Well," she said she didn\'t think I could remember that, but she says she remembers it vaguely. But then she also said - like my mother isn\'t sophisticated in hiding anything, right? She said that when my dad was in the second world war and went overseas, her sister, the one that was , her sister continually told her how easy he had it overseas, you know, off fighting the war, just sends his checks home, takes life easy, we back here have got to work. And they really got onto her about that, just all the way home, up until the time he got killed, and she took it that way. And so....And then another thing came clear: She reacts to that the way I react. She reacted to that by not even letting them know that she\'d been hurt and that this was hurting her and that she was angry about it. She just, you know...Hides it inside, same way that you do.Yeah, hides it inside, right, right, exactly like I do. And like I asked her about that, too, and then we got onto that.You mean why she does that. 0:18:05.8Yeah. I said, "Why do you do it that way? Why don\'t you let people know?" And she gave me this whole bullshit about - which I use - that there is this Bible passage about he being called to fire upon their head by doing kindness. And if your enemy hurts you, what you should do then is, instead of attacking him back angrily, you should be kind to him and that way you can hurt him, too, and I says, "Well, you\'re doing the same thing, you know."Kill him with kindness.Yeah, right, exactly, and this is what she said, you know, that she would try to do.You, too?I think, yeah. I used to always think that way. I think now - this is one of the questions I had, you know, like how does a mature person, or on the way or whatever, like how do you express - I can\'t believe you don\'t get angry. If you get angry, what do you do? I mean how do you vent your anger? I\'m asking you now, how you do that.I guess you\'re asking because you\'re not sure how else to do it.I don\'t know how. I mean I know how I\'ve done it.Which is to be kind to the other person.Yeah.And all day in the angry part inside of yourself. But I guess what you\'re saying is that you\'re being kind to the other person is really - for you, the way you\'re being hostile to him.Yeah, right. Well, I told my ma, I says, you know, "What you do with that is you confuse people, because they don\'t know, number one, you\'re hurt. They don\'t know, number two, you\'re angry."Yeah.Then when you react in a way that indicates you\'re kind you really screwed things up because then all the honest emotional responses aren\'t there and you really - it\'s fucked up. I guess I didn\'t say "fucked up." I still don\'t use that around... 0:20:08.1Okay, so what\'s the answer then?I don\'t know.[How would you do know] (ph)?Well, no, I don\'t trust myself to...Yeah, but you just said that if you don\'t react in an angry way, that is, if you act in the kind way, that just fucks us up.Yeah. Okay, I consider certain people mature people, and when they are angry - I guess when I think of anger I think of kind of almost losing some control, you know, and...Why do those two go together?Because anger kind of takes over and you don\'t control yourself, at least I guess I don\'t. I haven\'t been angry enough to know, and maybe that\'s why I\'m afraid... Like maybe if I\'m angry I\'m going to - well, number one, physically, I could massacre somebody, I know that for a fact, but I don\'t think that maybe is what I\'m afraid of. You know, you look so childish and silly, I think, when you\'re angry.I see. It is, like, again, you\'re being childish by expressing your emotions, by acting them out.Yeah, and you might regret what you do and you have nothing to make restitution...(Cross talk) happy birthday.Yeah, yeah.It\'s like you can\'t show any emotion or else that\'s going to be childish.You know, you can\'t control it, especially if it\'s negative. I don\'t think I can...Once you let go, once you become angry, you lose control.Yeah, but, you know, I\'m looking for like a guideline, I guess, but...How to hold onto yourself, how to hold the reins in so - what, so you can become angry about not losing control?No, I mean just to express the anger in a mature manner.Uh-huh.You know, now those are just sounding like words to me, but I can think of getting angry and hurt really bad once, when I got in a fight with a guy.Yeah.And this is way back, too, you know.Yeah.And it was probably the most painful thing that I can remember. Because this kid, we got in a fight down by - it was about when I was in ninth grade - we got in a fight down by the river that ran by our place. And I chased him for about six or seven blocks; he had hit me with a stick. Finally, I caught him and we got into this fight, and he got on top of me and had my arm behind me and just held it way up there, you know, and it hurt like hell, and I started blubbering. And I started with this whole thing on "You haven\'t been through what I\'ve been through," like I\'d really been through something, only I didn\'t know what the hell I\'d been through, like. I don\'t know what was in me. It was a whole...Okay, so your experience tells you that when you get angry you lose control. You went running after this kid...Yeah, but I didn\'t lose control......until he got the better of you, and then but you lost control not of your anger, (telephone ringing) the thought that you exposed yourself, exposed your...Yeah, that was - I said never again.(Answering call) Hello. Ah, yeah. Oh, okay. Let me transfer you to the reception desk. Could you hold on, please? 2360, please.Yup, that time, you know, I was really mad, and then, well, the guy had a hammer lock and I couldn\'t move. He held me for about a half an hour, and every time I\'d move he\'d yank that thing up tight. And not only was I physically beaten, but then I went into this whole thing on - all I remember saying is, "You haven\'t gone through what I\'ve gone through." 0:24:37.7You\'re getting angry and losing control and that really exposed your weaknesses.Yeah, yeah, that was... I couldn\'t face that kid for a year. I could never face him again. And then about two years later, he got killed...Like something grating.Yeah, yeah, really, because really, you know, I felt like just a complete ass. And two years later he got killed on a motorcycle, and I was almost glad he did, because he\'s the only one that I could remember that...Wanted to put the finger on you.Yeah, yeah. And since that time I can\'t remember ever really - no, that\'s too broad a thing. I must have let it go some time. But very, very seldom have I ever let go. Yeah, there are a couple of times I can recall when I\'ve kind of fallen. Well, just this last week, and this is why I couldn\'t do it. I knew what was even going on when it was going on, but I got castrated and my balls were cut out and on the floor and I was looking back at them. On Tuesday, I saw you on Tuesday.Yeah.It was Wednesday morning. I went, we had a meeting, and there is this girl in my office by the name of Sylvio, Susie Sylvio. And I know a little bit about her. I know she\'s separated from her husband; he\'s in a state psychiatric hospital, and I know that she is - she has been seeing a shrink for a couple of years. 0:26:29.8Right.And to me she\'s just - I bug her continually. I don\'t know why it is, but I will never give a straight line to Sylvio. I once in a while will be nice to her, but I... Because to me there\'s just - I don\'t know what it is. I just can\'t hack her. But I don\'t do it - you know, emotionally confront her. I\'ll just say, well, things, or she\'ll say, well, things, one way or another. But since we\'ve moved to the new office we\'ve been kind of nice to each other, you know, at least civil, civil.Yeah.Well, I have this concert coming up, the Messiah, and I\'m selling tickets for it; it\'s down in Orchestra Hall. And I went around to some of the people in the office and my friends and asked them if they\'d like to buy tickets, and most of them did. And Sylvio said she wanted two tickets; this is two weeks ago. It would have been the Monday before that. Sylvio said, yeah, she\'d buy two $4 tickets, and I says, "Fine." I said, "I\'ll get them" - this is what I said in the two weeks ago - I said, "I\'ll get them on Monday and I\'ll bring them on Tuesday." This is the Tuesday of the - [by year] (ph). The time sequence is important. I got in the argument with Sylvio on a Wednesday. The previous Monday was the day that I was going to get the tickets and give them to the people on Tuesday. On Monday, when I came to the - we practice on the [Logish Y] (ph). I came there, and last year they had a policy you pay them and you get the tickets right away, and the lady didn\'t have enough tickets with her that night. 0:28:02.1 So I gave her the money, it was 42 bucks, and she said she\'d give me the tickets the next Monday so I didn\'t have them on Tuesday. Sylvio comes up to me on Wednesday, the day after this meeting, and she says, "Alector, where are my tickets?" And I said, "Well, I gave them the money, but the tickets won\'t be here until next Monday, I\'ll give them to you on Tuesday then." And she says, "What do you mean you don\'t have my tickets?" She said, "Alector, you\'re notorious around here for always being broke," she says, "and I am not going to finance your Thanksgiving vacation." She says, "I\'m not going to finance you having a good time on Thanksgiving." In other words, I was taking the money, you know, and I\'m going out and I don\'t know what she thought.Spending her money.Yeah, well, that was the big thing. There were all kinds of things I thought; well, it could be one or it could be another. But when I looked at her I think - like I think Sylvio - I know she\'s always so straight and so controlled and so in charge that I almost thought - you know, she has steel gray eyes, but she said it almost emotionlessness, you know, and she says, "I want my money back." Well, first of all, I think, you know, she is kidding.Yeah.I mean what the hell? And then she says, "I want my money back," and I says, "Okay, fine." And I said, "Have you got two ones," and she says, "Yeah." And so I gave her her 10 bucks and she gives me the two ones and I couldn\'t believe it. But I never... She made these comments, number one, about that I was always broke. Well, I always pay you back, too, I pay you back right away; secondly, about my having a good time and her financing it. And the implication was that I had just railroaded all these people into paying for their damn tickets and then not...Okay, what are you saying? That you should have been angry at her for doing this to you? 0:30:06.0Well, then, after she walked away, then I sat there for five minutes and I says, "you know, I\'ve really been raped," because she said all this shit and I...And you didn\'t fight back.No, no, no, I just did what she wanted. I gave her her money back. And then while it was going on I knew that things were irritating me here, but I didn\'t know what to do, so in effect, she castrates me and gets away scot-free. And I know Sylvio\'s weak points. I know what I can attack her on.You could have gotten back at her is what you\'re saying.Yeah, yeah, but I mean the least I could have...I should have.Yeah, right, and I didn\'t. I don\'t know what I would have done. Number one, she would have made a fool of me.Why? How?Emotionally, I would have been a fool.What do you mean?I would have gotten had, number one.Yeah.And I was stuttered or something like that, I wouldn\'t have made sense, which is part of the thing she always wants to bug me about anyhow.How does she know that? You\'ve never gotten angry in front of her.Well, I think what she would have wanted to see me do was something like that.How do you know?Because otherwise, you know, like it was so...How do you know you would have stuttered if you were angry?Well, I think I would have looked foolish. And there\'s one thing I...[Well, what would all of that mean] (ph)?All right, to look foolish in Sylvio\'s eyes, I would imagine. It would have been like being in her power or something like that.In what way?Well, she would have succeeded in getting me angry, for one, which I think she tries to do. Not easy, but I think I\'m missing something here. But I\'m trying to avoid something, but honest, I don\'t know what I\'m trying to avoid. 0:32:19.0Well, what you said was that you were trying to avoid being embarrassed or looking like a fool.No, no, no. I\'m trying to avoid saying something and I don\'t know what I\'m trying to avoid.Okay. Okay.Because I feel like I\'m hedging her on. Okay, when I was talking to her, you know, just prior to this, I could not look her in the eye. I would glance to the side like that, and she could look me right in the eye, but I could not face her and allow myself to get a little emotionally pissed at her. I could not look her in the eye and probably still get mad. I think she did, you know. I think on that kind of a confrontation she would have proved stronger than me, and I would never admit that to Sylvio.How do you know?I believe it.Why? I guess what you\'re saying is that you\'re afraid that the incident that happened when you were in ninth grade would have been repeated; that is, that somebody would have gotten the better of you.I know I can beat Sylvio rationally, as long as we\'re both being cool and as long as, you know - as long as we\'re just using the room.(Cross talk) lose control.Yeah, right, as long as we...She\'ll retain control and be rational and reasonable.No, no. What she will do...Yeah. 0:33:54.8She won\'t be able - because I don\'t think she can express her emotions any better than I can, just by watching - by seeing the look in her eyes. But what would have happened, if I would have lost control, I think she would have still been at that same rational level and still - and she would have beat me, and that\'s kind of been like our game all the time. As long as I\'m using the words, or hitting and running around or making little comments, you know, I would never get beat by Sylvio. But if we got in the situation where, I was operating emotionally, like I would have been there, you know. I could feel it just coming, and if we were to bolt to the doors, I would have looked like a complete ass, I\'m sure, just a complete ass.Because you would have lost control.Yeah, I would have gotten angry, and I think she would have beaten me, which she would have beaten it.Okay, angry means losing control for you.Yeah. And she would have beaten me down, because I know she would have just remained at her own level.Because she can get angry without losing control?Well, that\'s what I was going to say. I was going to say that, for her, you know, like emotionally and rationally might operate on the same level, although I\'ve never seen her emotional. She\'s sensitive I\'m told. Her friend says she\'s very sensitive, but she certainly covers it well. And I says, "I know she\'s sensitive," I say, but that\'s what\'s crazy, because if you\'re nice to her, if you\'re kind to her, it gets to be such a stagnant thing it\'s unbearable; I can\'t stand that. And if you\'re not nice to her at least - it\'s at least somewhat lifeful (ph). But yeah, if I would have got mad, you know, she could have said, you know, she did really one-up on me and I don\'t know if - and I couldn\'t face it. I could not confront her. I could not directly meet her at the level where I should have met her. I couldn\'t meet her on an emotional level. 0:36:29.4Yeah, but I\'m still trying to figure out what that level is.All right. Let\'s say she throws an insult in my face, you know, which is, point blank, insult.Yeah.She didn\'t throw it in an angry manner, she threw it in a half-smiling kidding tone.COUNSELER: Yeah. But it\'s still the same thing. And then she pressed the point. Okay, now I couldn\'t - I didn\'t retaliate. I couldn\'t retaliate. I couldn\'t really...How could you retaliate? What are the alternatives? The first one and the only one that you think of is to get angry and lose control.Yeah, but no, okay. I think that because I think that\'s what I felt like doing.You felt like getting angry.Yeah. Well, I did...And if you get angry you\'ll lose control. You don\'t want to lose control.Yeah, well, what I did, I got defensive, and she says, "Now, where are the tickets?" I explained where the tickets are, and then she starts pumping me, and with each pump I give her explanations, you know, when I should have just said, you know - well, what I felt like saying was - I know how I think I can get to Sylvio and I maybe, you know...What you felt like saying was...Well, originally I should have just said, "Okay, bitch, here\'s your money back, you know," or something where I wouldn\'t have been smiling, where at least she would have got the idea I wasn\'t completely happy and where I wouldn\'t have felt like she was calling the shots that... Well, to top it off, I haven\'t talked to her since, but you know, like I don\'t want to avoid her now; it\'s almost that thing. But I know she\'s going to ask me for those damn tickets. 0:38:37.8After you\'ve given her the money back?Yes, yes, yes. I said, "Here\'s your money back, Sylvio." And I had told her previously that I had paid for the things already, so I don\'t know if she\'s been thinking about it at all, but she must think I sold all those tickets. So I told the lady at the window, I said, you know, "I don\'t want the two fours," and then I got my money back. But you know, it\'s like I\'ve got a plan now what to say to her. It\'s like deviously planning what to say to her, because I\'m sure she\'ll ask for the tickets.How about telling her the truth, that you told the lady at the window that you didn\'t want the tickets.She\'ll say, "Why?"I\'m now telling you the truth, that you felt she was no longer interested in going, because you\'ve given her her money back. Somehow I guess I have the feeling you want to get back at her though.Yeah, that\'s the thing. That would be a mature way of doing it. 0:40:05.4Um-hmm.My way of doing it would be to say something to purposely plan to get mad, you know, plan to call her a couple of names, and there are certain areas that I think anything related to her femininity would get her uptight. I don\'t know what it would accomplish, because I don\'t... That sort of answer would be like the answer which would be honest and it would be what I\'d want to give, but I wonder...It wouldn\'t really satisfy you.No, it would, because that\'s exactly what happened. And it does convey - it almost conveys a sort of reproach, you know, which I feel but I didn\'t express to her. You know, like afterwards people came up and said, "Did Sylvio really get her money back?" I says, "Yeah," and they were all on my side, of course.Well, then you don\'t have to get back at her, do you? You already have.Not at her, though, I\'m saying, not at her. See, the thing I...You want to do it personally. You want to do it yourself.Yeah, but I feel - I know it would be fake if I didn\'t want to have this all planned out. "Okay, now, Sylvio, I\'m really going to get mad at you." See, I don\'t think you can face Sylvio.You don\'t think you can face her?No, not... I really feel shaky if I know it\'s heading for a certain level. 0:42:15.8For the level of a confrontation between the two of you.Yeah, yeah. You know, like doing it almost the way that you had mentioned is almost, well... I was going to say it\'s almost like being nice, but really being something else underneath. I think part of the thing that got me was that my integrity was called into question, too. She said, you know, things like - she made implications about that I borrowed money, as though I never paid the money back, or that I was purposely cheating all these people so that I would have a good time on Thanksgiving, I had no other way to do it. All those kinds of things came into my head. And then the way she said "I\'m not going to give you money so you can have a good time on Thanksgiving," which to me meant good time with some chick on Thanskgiving, you know, at my expense. But at the time all I could do was just... 0:44:06.3Fade away.Yeah, just kind of limp out of there is what I really did and I didn\'t...With only one (cross talk).It\'s almost like when somebody is staring at you and you can\'t look at them.Yeah.And you look away. And to look at them, you can\'t do it. The same thing happened to me two nights ago, when I was playing ball, basketball, and that I think was a black/white thing. But it was ridiculous; 29-year-old guys were playing basketball, were playing with - or I guess there were four black guys against four white guys, you know, nice little get-together, and it was over at Settlement House, and Settlement House is more black guys than white guys so it\'s kind of like their ground. And it was unbelievable; we were going for a rebound and this friend of mine, who never admits he\'s wrong, was under, you know, going for the ball. One of the fat guys gave him an elbow; moved him out, you know. We got the rebound anyhow, so one of the other guys got it. But my friend says, you know, [push and fell underneath which called in a foul] (ph). Well, we had the damn ball so it didn\'t really matter, but the guy that did the pushing, supposedly, got the ball and says, "Our ball," you know. Well, this other guy started an argument, and those guys argued for 20 minutes while the rest of us stood around. And I\'m sitting there trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Usually you settle it by shooting a free throw. Neither of those guys would shoot a free throw, one black guy and one white guy.And then the guy I was guarding was a guy about my age, a black guy. And he says - and I can\'t understand it. I know what it is. I know how a black athlete will antagonize you; it\'s a way. I\'ve felt it before and I can\'t quite explain it, but I could not face that guy. And finally I said to him, I said, "This is a black/white thing." That\'s the only way I could say it. But it was a way that I knew I was being confronted. 0:46:22.9You, as well as the guy who was fouled.Yeah, well, I didn\'t even enter into the argument. I figured those guys can blast it off, but the guy that I was talking to, as soon as I said black/white thing, he started laughing like mad, you know, as though I didn\'t know what I was talking about. Well, the point is I could go on and on about what I thought was going on, the difference between, let\'s say, a black athlete and a white athlete. But the point is that I felt like an idiot because I could not face the guy, I could not explain myself, and he was getting me mad. I told him three times, I says, "You\'re getting me mad, fellow," because he did stuff underneath, you know. And in athletics it\'s a little different; I\'ll flip elbows and stuff like that; I don\'t worry about that. You know, somebody gets rough with me and then I\'ll retaliate it, but not when it comes...So it\'s like you can only retaliate physically with another guy.Yeah.Even more than that, only on an athletic playing field.Right, right, yeah. Well, it\'s just coincidental that all this stuff kind of happened, or maybe it\'s that I\'m more aware of...And you couldn\'t respond to him verbally, just...No, no, he...(Cross talk) Sylvio.No, he beat the hell out of me verbally. I mean I\'m sure he was - he was laughing like it\'s - I can\'t say it\'s true across the board. I still haven\'t figured out if it\'s just blackness or whiteness or if it\'s a way of being for a certain person. Like a black athlete, these guys could be relaxed, play the game, you know, make it look like they\'re not giving a damn at all. We\'re hustling, we\'re hustling, screaming out, you know, setting plays up. They\'re just being cool, you know. And, you know, most of the time we split about even, but when they lose it\'s like, "Oh, we didn\'t try anyhow." And if they win, you know, it was no sweat, "You guys were a walkover." 0:48:24.9You know, it\'s hard to define that, you know. I don\'t know my racist things, you know, but that\'s something I\'ve got to work on, too, because I think I\'ve got them, but it\'s very hard to define. And that thing, you know, what I can\'t seem to crack - like I thought, you know, okay, if I go back, go back to my ma, go back to my early upbringing, I can find - and I think I get indications of what might contribute to the thing.But still you can\'t...No, but I -Can\'t put the pieces together.No, and I can\'t do it with - I still cannot react spontaneous. Right after that I told Wesley is like my confidante there, an older lady - I says, you know, this is what happened, bing bing bing bing, and this is what it should...Do you call all women by their last names?I do that a lot. It depends. But Wesley, I always call her Wesley.Sylvio you call Sylvio.And Sylvio I call Sylvio.How about that?Girl I date I call Susan, but not - I call her Galione. But I\'ve done that before, you know, a lot.Yes, it strikes me that you said before that Sylvio-Susie - the way to get to her was via her femininity, right?Yeah.What does it mean to call her Sylvio, like she\'s another one of the guys? I mean I think that you\'ve gotten to her already. 0:50:10.6By using that.So her response is, "I\'m going to get back at you, boy. I\'m going to accuse you of absconding with my money."I always call her Sylvio.She finally had her chance to get back.Yeah. I call a lot of girls by their last name. Well,It\'s always good to end a session with a bombshell.Yeah, Sylvio. Yeah, I\'ve done that all along, yeah. In fact, I don\'t think I\'ve really called her Susie. That\'s bad news. Now I\'m not going to be pissed at her.COUNSELER: Hmm? Now I won\'t be pissed at her, but that\'s what\'s going to happen. I\'ve just got a feeling, a definite feeling. This is for Thursday, right?Yeah, right?Okay. I\'ll go home and mediate. I\'ll see you.Okay, bye. 0:51:44.1', 'Man, I\'m tired.Me too.You work all day?Yeah. I had three occupants last night. Did you work all day?Well, I was around. I could have come tomorrow because my friend decided to change his mind and meet today.So you\'ve moved today already, huh?No, I didn\'t know it. He didn\'t tell me. So he didn\'t do it himself, and I walked downtown past his house and there\'s a rent-a-truck in his front yard and, "What\'s going on?" Should be gone by the time he\'s back. I had a really beautiful time Sunday night. I decided that I was going to try and see what hitchhiking was like, and so I started walking through Long Island, mailed the letter, and then walked out the other end of town. And I was going to see the (inaudible aTHERAPIST:24) the (gonya) (ph) at Central Park and (Greenwich village) (ph), and so I just started sticking out my thumb, walked backwards for about half a mile. Couple a thousand cars must have passed and then finally somebody decided to pick me up. So he took about... I\'d say about three or four miles, then dropped off, and then I got another ride after I walked about another half mile, and then another ride for about another two miles. And then I walked the rest of the way, because nobody picked me up. That was in the afternoon too. It was light. And altogether it\'s about... I don\'t know, I\'d say at least 10 or 12 miles there from my house to the hospital, and I was kind of getting achy when I got there. So when we got there, we messed around for a while. Then we went in this restaurant... by then there were three of us. Sheila and one of her girlfriends come along with us. And so we went in this restaurant and we ordered one of these all you can eat dinners; just one because that\'s all the money we had, and the waitress looked at us kind of funny and just brought it out.Too funny.And then on our way back, it was about evening time. I should have gone home. I walked all the way back from the park. I got a ride for about three miles to the island. These two girls were stopped at a light and I was walking past the light and they said, "You want a ride?", and I went, "Why didn\'t you pick up back there a 100 yards when I saw you?", because it was a really long light, and "Yeah sure, I want a ride". So they give me a ride. I was kind of surprised they picked me up. Most people are scared. I was doing the Long Island. In fact, I was in Long Island. I mean, some guy picked me up and took me the last mile and a half to my house to where... So I figure I walked a total of about 15 or 16 miles. [:46]But you enjoyed it?Yeah.The whole thing.I just... this rock in my hand you know, because just coming out of Long Island when I was leaving, some guy tried to hit me. So I picked up a rock, you know, and I carry this rock because if anybody tried to hit me then I\'d just put it through their windshield, so I could identify the car later. You can\'t cover up a broken windshield very easy, and it would be kind of like revenge, you know.Um hm. You could get back at him.And I had this rock. Just kept squeezing it to keep my hands warm. It was about 45 outside, and it builds up your (hands) (ph) too. People they just... they drive by and they honk. Now you\'re nowhere near the road, but they honk. There\'s this one guy. He was really out of it. I walk on the sidewalk in my neighborhood and he... he\'s driving by and I... all I do was turn around. I didn\'t even put my thumb out. And he looks at me and he puts his finger to the side of his temple, you know, like you\'re nuts, you know.Like maybe loony, yeah. Yeah.And I... I just broke out laughing.Laughter.It was so funny. People are so... I despise them. I was just... I was laughing at them really.You were kind of making fun of them to yourself you mean? [:18]Yeah, the way they act is so insane. Like I was almost to the hospital, just about a mile to go. I was getting pretty tired, and this woman and her husband - she was driving. They were old. - came down off the toll way and they... they were stopped, looking at this map. And so I was walking by, you know, because they hadn\'t picked me up when they went by me. And I said, "Can I help you, huh? Are you lost? Need some help? I know the area a little bit around here, you know.", and this old man wouldn\'t even open the window. And his wife looks at him and says, "Open the window for that young man.", and he opened it about a half inch, you know. And I said, "Oh, where you going?", you know, and he says, "Berkeley", and I thought, "Oh, no, there isn\'t no town named Berkeley around the north side that I know of. And I was going to get wise and say, "California, no.", but I said, "Well, look on the... on the index of towns there because I can\'t help you.", and I just kept walking. People are so messed up. I heard President Nixon talk about his silent majority. There is a silent majority.[Look at us.] (ph)They\'re all mixed up. Me too. I mean, one car out of 10,000 that passed me picked me up. I didn\'t count them, but if I did it\'d get unaccountable.But I guess you did probably because you were curious to see what would happen.Because that...What kind of people you\'d meet.Like I mean, I had a theory that only nice people going to pick you up, because as long as I\'ve been driving and picked up people, I only found nice people that I picked up, you know. They\'re the only ones that have the guts to stick out their thumb, and I guess it works the other way too. The only people that pick you up are the nice ones that have the guts to [have conflict] (ph). [:39] Of course, it works different if you\'re a girl. Like when Josie hitchhikes, you know, she never knows who she\'s going to get, you know. There are all kinds of weirdoes. She\'s also been gang banged a couple times.Who\'s Josie?My friend in the hospital. She somehow manages to get out of it. Jumps out of the cars while they\'re still moving. Just says, "I\'m getting out.", and opens the door.And gets out. (laughs)Yeah. And sometimes she\'s already at the stop sign and doing things like that, you know. When a guy sees that\'s going to happen, he usually stops. She says, "Thanks for the ride.", and kicks the door closed. The guy gets so mad and she starts swearing at him. I don\'t know, you equated that (car) (ph) to getting around.You kind of admire her way of doing things?Not really. I admire her for having the courage of hitchhiking, yeah. She just worries too much; very, very intolerant towards people even her friends. Like when she sits there talking with other people that were in the hospital while I was in there, like she\'ll sit there... really it\'s kind of biting, cutting, the way she talks about some people, you know, and then she\'ll look at me, "Now isn\'t that true?" And I have to... I can\'t say yes, even though if it is true, you know, because I didn\'t see it that way. I have to kind of rephrase it, you know, because I don\'t like to be cutting about people. [:36] I think she was telling this other girl about how ugly this girl in the hospital was while I was in there, how ugly she was. And Josie said, "Wasn\'t she ugly?", and I says, "Well". I just said, "Well", you know, and then the other girl she was asking says, "She wasn\'t very pretty was she?", and I said, "No". She said, "That\'s very diplomatic of you".But... and you have to be careful that you don\'t...I don\'t like to cut down people, because really it doesn\'t help anybody. I was mowing my grandmother\'s lawn yesterday, and that\'s a major accomplishment because it was about a foot high.Yeah, wow. (laughs)Because it hadn\'t been... it\'s a small... I mean, you know, so it wasn\'t like...With a hand mower?Well, it\'s a push mower, you know.That you push, yeah.It\'s a mower. It has a motor on it.Oh, fine.No, and I wouldn\'t have attempted it with the other. (chuckles) But I... I could kind of mechanic when I did it, you know, and I had started thinking about how violent everything is.What surrounds you.Yeah. I read something in the... in the paper about how the whole American system is based on conflict, you know. Don\'t seem so simplistic.Seems very true to you and yet very crazy is what you\'re saying here.Yeah. And I... like I always think back over the past, like this school or places that I have been, restaurants or something, where someone\'s always playing the hard guy, you know. And... whenever I\'m in a place like that; when someone else is in a place like that that is violent, I can always imagine some kind of a meeting between us, a confrontation of some kind, and before I always thought, "Well, if that happens, [:51] you know, I\'m just going to flatten them, no sweat. And yesterday I thought, you know, "How dumb that is.", you know. Now I think I would say, "Oh, you stupid, violent people.", and walk around... walk... turn around and walk away.What is that feeling? It\'s just senseless and that you don\'t have to be caught up in that?It\'s kind of a... kind of like I\'m above it, you know.Above it, separate from it, and...And I want no part of it, you know.And... and better than the people who are in that... that part of it?Oh, the people that are in it I kind of pity. Maybe because I was part of that, you know.And you pity the part of you that was in that too?Yeah, because I know what\'s it like to have to... it\'s really not being hot; it\'s just fear, you know, and that\'s... that\'s the part of it that I pity them.But so are you saying that now, if you were in that situation, you would be free of that fear?Yeah. Because partly it\'s... I have no desire to impress anybody really. [:25]No desire to show somebody how strong you can be, or how violent, or something?Yeah. I\'m just there. (chuckles)That... from the way you\'re talking, that shows that you want to bring it out that you can be above it. It gives you a releasing feeling, or like you\'re freer that way, or... or just what?Yeah, kind of. I kind of don\'t have to worry with a big guy following you on the expressway that\'s going to start ramming you or something, you know.(chuckles)It... I just... I don\'t know.Doesn\'t matter.It\'s just less living. When I was walking to neighborhood, the Island police stopped me there every night for a... a routine field investigation, and I was standing there aTHERAPIST:00 at night shivering, and they\'re going through their routine field investigation for a half an hour. Have to check my complete record; see if I\'m wanted anywhere and see if I\'m a draft evader; check my draft status. Well, I guess they must have had it all on their... on their computers. I knew they were on the radio, you know. So he just... he goes back and forth to the radio about four or five times and stands there talking to them. That\'s why he...What...What a waste of time, a whole hour. (chuckles)Seems like ridiculous to you, huh?Yeah. It was kind of scary at the time.Scary at the time?Yeah. I thought, "Oh, no, you know, I\'m going to get busted for something.", because if they want to bust you, they can bust you for something and that\'s just what I need right now. [:38]And you were afraid if they had it in for you, they would find something on you?Well, they don\'t have to have it in... they don\'t have to find anything to have it in for you, you know. I had really nothing on me except my empty wallet.But you felt very vulnerable to what might happen if they did it?Well, yeah, I mean... a policeman has a very free rein on a society, especially now. Well, maybe not especially now, but it sure seems that way to me.Did you feel like a pawn in that _______________?Well, kind of like, you know... he could have picked me up for anything.(crosstalk)He could have said he saw me hitchhiking when I wasn\'t. I was walking then, because I knew nobody was going to pick me up because there wasn\'t any lighter than that, and there was no cars. (chuckles) He could get me for vagrancy I bet, because I didn\'t have enough money on me. That wouldn\'t be hard to prove.Like you wouldn\'t have to do anything.Yeah, you\'re just walking through. Because I\'ve driven through that town before.What... what is that a feeling of the great riskiness of that or what?That\'s kind of like here\'s your public defender supposed to be helping you out. All he does is detain you. Once you\'re free, he sends you on your way walking. He doesn\'t even take you to the city lines. [:13]Sort of a mild bitterness that that\'s kind of the way it happens?Yeah. Because I... I\'ve been picked up in the neighborhood before for... one time... I had one taillight out. I had four taillights on the car. I had one out. They picked me up for that, and then the other time my license plate was dirty. They didn\'t like that. (chuckles)(laughs) Seriously, they picked you up for that?Seriously... I\'m serious, they did. It\'s ridiculous, but Long Island is... it\'s known for that kind of thing now. That... it\'s almost as if they have nothing else to do, and on top of it when they stopped me, they had a backup car, an unmarked one, come out and sit there for about 15 minutes. And then he left and another squad car pulled up. So I\'m sitting there with two squad cars, and then when the second squad car pulled up, the guy pulled... turned on the blinkers on the top. So here\'s this big... big thing with the... with the blinkers going on, and then you look for the main road and I\'m standing there with my hands over my head, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying. It was really weird.It sounds like you was going through all this and you\'re frightened by it and almost amused by it all at the same time.Ridiculous. It\'s amazing how... how they can get away with that kind of thing. (chuckles)You don\'t think it\'s funny anymore?And I had to be... I had to be home by:30, you know, and I figured, "Well, I\'m going to end up walking and there\'s no way". You know, I didn\'t know if I was going to make it or not, because I wasn\'t walking very fast by then. Maybe they thought I was stoned, because I wasn\'t walking very fast. They asked me where I came from. I said, "The City. I knew it was a risk if I walked". "Where you going?" "The Island". "How you going to get there?" "I\'m going to walk". "I don\'t believe you". (chuckles)It sounds like you..."Go put your cap on again" [I think he said] (ph).It sounds like the way you talk, sounds like you weren\'t... I don\'t know, almost like you weren\'t in it, like it could have been a movie going on or...I didn\'t... I... yeah, I believed it.I mean, like you believed it.It\'s just I didn\'t really care. [:27]Yeah. Yeah. You were indifferent to... in a way to it; to what was going on.I... I... I knew that they couldn\'t... even if they did keep me legally after my curfew, then it wasn\'t my fault and I wouldn\'t get screwed for it, and I had nothing to hide, so I just went along and played their games. Now if I would have had something to lose, like if I would have been carrying something that I shouldn\'t have. Like I was thinking of carrying this pipe, you know, in my belt loops where they wouldn\'t find it. They would have found it, you know, and then I would have really had it. At the time, I was carrying a rockedy [jam pack] (ph). That didn\'t go over too good. They didn\'t see it though I guess. That\'s amazing. The guy... he frisked me twice, and then he sits there and he goes back on his radio and he has me standing in front of the car, and I just politely dropped the rocks, you know. I could have knocked him out while he was bending over or something. It\'s really weird how dumb the policemen are.It\'s... it\'s a very strange feeling to be in that situation and have them not notice that and...Yeah, it\'s really. It\'s... it is playing a game, in that the policemen themselves make it a game. Nobody else does. They just kind of...It sounds like them playing it somehow causes you to play it too. So you\'re both playing a game.Yeah. Well, really, you see if they was doing what they\'re supposed to be doing, like running around and nailing people speeding, and stopping bank robberies, and that such... sort of thing. No, they\'re picking up people off the streets, because they have nothing left to do. And I said, "Are you done with me? [It\'s a really hot night.] (ph)" I said, "There\'s all kinds of things to do. And then they can afford to send two squad cars; my neighborhood only has five squad cars, and one of them is not in use at any time, which means that\'s half their force tied up with me doing nothing. So... [:25]Seems pretty ludicrous to you, pretty funny. [Think fast] (ph)(chuckles) The crowning thing; after the whole thing is over, the cop says, "Well, I guess you\'re okay.", and I says, "That\'s nice. Now can I keep going now, or can you give me a ride to the... to the line now?", and I... I didn\'t ask. I didn\'t have the guts to ask them. I [just turned around] (ph). I didn\'t think I\'d get it anyway. "Bye guys". So I just started walking and the cop says, "Oh, good luck on your court.", and I said, "Oh, brother". (chuckles) I was about to turn around and really lay into him, you know, just start yelling at him or something. I couldn\'t...It made you really angry that... what was it? That he was taking it that lightly?Well, he... he detains me this whole time. I\'m standing there freezing. He won\'t even let me sit in his squad car. They have things in the back of the squad car where you... they can sit... where you can sit now. I mean, there\'s no handles on the insides of the doors and so, you know, you can\'t get away. You can\'t do anything because you\'re in the back. But no, no. Nice warm squad car, but I was standing out there in front of his headlights so he can watch me, and then he has the nerve to wish me good luck, you know.So you were pretty angry when you left there and pretty disgusted?Yeah. Kind of glad it was over though.Um hm. Relieved.Yeah. And then I wondered about, "What am I going to ask them?" to play the games of fencing with the police. They didn\'t act that bad though. They\'re a lot better than a girl. You have to do something to get them to stop you. I said that how many doing hitchhiking are going to do it to (Coney Island) (ph) the other way, completely opposite direction. [:44]You aren\'t going to try this again?Not that way. (chuckles) I might start in Brighton and go up to Coney Island, but I doubt it. I\'ve been walking around Long Island a lot lately, you know. Seen a lot of people that I never saw before.So, you\'re noticing things that you hadn\'t noticed before now?Um. Seemed pretty nice. I used to... for the least little thing and I\'d go downtown and drive my car, like if I need a quart of milk, or I got to mail a letter, got to get some gas, you know. I used this... I... I always looked forward to this drive downtown, you know. I don\'t drive downtown anymore. I walk.And you choose to walk now.And [I pull that night thing] (ph). Some of the streets are pretty boring though.Was it more peaceful?Yeah.And more interesting things to see with?Yeah, and I\'m not polluting the air, (chuckles) and I\'m not wasting on gasoline either. I\'ve been running on this tank of gasoline for almost a week and I figure I have at least two or three days left on it, you know, which is nice. [:07] Called my girl last night. The money I saved [for not] (ph) _______________.I see. I see. That was your... that was what you were saving for?No, but you know, I\'m... I\'m generally conserving money right now.I see.Permits the one thing that I can... I\'ve spent a little bit on is keeping in touch with her. I mean, I was pretty mad at the beginning, because I told her in a letter the week before that I was going to call her aTHERAPIST:30 last night or:00, you know. So I called at ten to and nobody was there. Called at five to; it was busy. Called aTHERAPIST:00; nobody was there. Called at five after; it was busy. So (chuckles) nobody\'s there, then it\'s busy. Nobody\'s there, then it\'s busy. I mean, ten minutes either side of when I was supposed to call, you know. So about 12 after I called and she picks it up and she says, "Hi", you know, and I said, "Hi, Jess. Where were you?", you know. And she said, "I\'ve... I\'ve been sitting here for the past half hour waiting for your call". I guess the... the lines are getting crossed up, because then they have a party line on top of it, and she failed to inform the other people on the party line that she was expecting a call. So anyway, finally got through, and then... then it was pretty nice. I hadn\'t talked to her for about a week.But it was good to hear from her _______________.It was kind of discouraging a little bit, because just the fact that I was talking to her kind of rubbed it in because she was there and I was here.Um hm, and the fact that you had to talk to her over the telephone too?Yeah. I almost started crying. [:14]Just thinking about her being gone there?Yeah.And how much you miss her?Yeah. That\'s what I told her. I said, "I miss you a whole lot.", and she said, "I missed you too". I think she misses me more than I miss her, because there\'s so much... it\'s kind of like an insecurity of this, you know, what far away from home means, not really knowing too many people.But it sounds like you miss her pretty much too, um hm.Yeah. I wish I didn\'t have these idiotic travel _______________.They keep you from seeing her.Um hm. And sometimes I think that maybe I should get used to it. Good possibility of this happening for a long time.It really is. Fear of flying; it\'s going to be here for a long time too.Just kind of... I don\'t know, just kind of accept it. Not like it\'s something that, "Oh, I have to do this.", you know. It\'s just kind of taking it, you know. It still hurts a little bit to think about it.It hurts. I guess it leaves kind of a hole in your life with her going?Um hm, and to know that maybe I\'m not going to see her for a long, long time.It\'s like a long time stretching out.I just wonder how she would ever get up to Fargo, North Dakota? That\'s what I think aboutIt seems pretty far I know, doesn\'t it?Yeah._______________Need someone to speak to, you know. [:50]It\'s really, really hard to think... thinking about a separation.It\'s lonely, but it\'s not really too hard, so I just kind of keep myself busy doing things, you know. I don\'t think about it, then it\'s not hard at all really, because I\'m all caught up in what I\'m doing, you know. But then sometimes at night I think... I kind of dream about what it would be like to take a camping trip or something with her, you know.It\'s only when you stop being busy that it really feels bad?Yeah.When you think about the things you could be doing together.Yeah. Think about some of the beautiful places that I\'ve seen that I\'d like to go with her.You\'d like to share with her. [:09]Yeah. I don\'t think she\'s ever been camping. I think she\'d like it. I think she\'d like it a lot. And when I start thinking about that, that\'s when it hurts because that\'s... like that\'s even farther away than even just seeing that.And it\'s so long before you can do those kind of things.My idea of a camping trip with her would be in Canada. I\'d really like that. Well, you drive for 80, 90 miles on a gravel road, and then you come to the end of the road and you just park there and you start walking. (crosstalk)(crosstalk) stuff?Yeah. We\'ve done a lot of canoeing, so I [wouldn\'t think it\'d hurt] (ph). Because I really... I like the towns, the country up there. I used to go up there all the time. Not that far, but to - what is it? Toronto? No.But it\'s beautiful, like it\'s wild country up there...Yeah....and you can just imagine...Very few people too. That would be... that would be really nice to be alone with her with no fathers; nobody looking over your shoulder.You could do just what you like.Nobody putting the spotlight on you when you\'re parked at night. Like with some people are afraid to be with another person for a long time, you know, because they think, you know, "Well, it\'s going to start going bad.", and usually it does, you know. But I don\'t think that would happen. I think it would get better. I think it would.And you\'re not worried about that at all?Uh huh.Wow. The two of you would grow closer if you spent more time together? [:57]You see, I think part of it is like we would be completely free to express anything we wanted to each other. But like that\'s always kind of a hang-up, because whenever we... just being with each other, you know. There\'s always somebody else around, and that kind of bothers her sometime and sometimes it kind of bugs me.You\'re never really alone together.Yeah. It\'s like there\'s always somebody there, like it\'s a party or something, you know.There\'s somebody there (crosstalk)Or a show. Yeah. You\'re always waiting for somebody to walk in.And you can never be totally relaxed and say and do just what you two want to.Uh huh. I read an article today in a... one of these outdoor magazines, you know. Like these guys took a... they drove up to this place. It cost them about $50 a piece, just their expenses. They parked on this road and took their canoe on this lake; went to the other end of the lake; foraged; went to the other end of another lake. I mean, they just took two weeks, and they only saw three people the whole time they were there, and that was when, you know, they came back.Wouldn\'t that be great?Yeah. Just... not for a long time; just for a little while. [:38]Kind of what I\'m hearing is there\'s... that it\'s such a luxury to get away by yourself somewhere?Um hm. (inaudible aTHERAPIST:50) really there. Nobody makes you pay to live.And then here, you\'re always having to pay for things, but out there you...You don\'t have money to do that. You\'re either in debt or in jail. There if you don\'t... if you do have money, it doesn\'t matter. It\'s not going to help you.And... and that\'s something it sounds like that would make you feel more secure because you don\'t have that much, and it also sounds like you like that idea.Yeah. I kind of like that [you talk permissive] (ph). I enjoyed it, because that\'s what you want.Um hm. What you really want is something for nothing; something you don\'t have to pay for.You got to pay for a fishing license.(chuckles) I... I also am hearing it like there aren\'t that many things in your life that you\'ve ever felt you\'ve had without paying for them.No, there\'s not. Whatever I got and didn\'t have to pay for was usually what I didn\'t want, and then whatever I really needed, I usually ended up paying double for or more than I thought was... you know, after I had it, I thought, "That was what I wanted". It wasn\'t worth half as much money.It sounds like it\'s almost hard for you even to imagine what it would be like to get something without having to really pay... pay over for it.Like right now, I\'m... I\'m trying to work out a deal where I trade this... this engine I have that has a cracked bracket, but it has all brand new racing parts in it, and I\'ve had it for about a year and a half now. It\'s never been run or anything, so all the parts are in perfect condition, and they\'re all very good quality materials that are in it. There\'s nothing really slipshod about it, and if I can sell that engine to this guy, I know another guy that has a rebuilt transmission that he will give me for virtually nothing. So I may end up selling something that\'s useless to me and getting something that I can use, then maybe a little money on top of that.Wouldn\'t that be really good [if you set this one up] (ph)...Yeah....to gain something?If it works, or if... if I could work some kind of a trade deal. I know what... what would happen I think but... I have... I have something that someone else wants, and I want something that someone else has, and I just hope it works out. [:14] I think part of it is too that... like working with cars and stuff, I end up with all these exotic speed equipment cars, which are really useless for what I want to build, you know, and it\'s really good stuff but I can\'t use any of it.Uh huh. Uh huh. It\'d be good for somebody, but not you.It\'s worthless to me. I don\'t know. I don\'t want to... if I possibly can, I think I\'m going to try and buy a truck; not buy, but trade my car for a truck, you know, an old camper, or a van, or something like that, because I have an engine sitting in the garage. I have two engines right now. One I\'m going to use some day, and the other one I\'m going to throw out if nobody buys it. I have an engine for... that\'ll fit in the truck. I have a transmission for it. They\'re both in good shape, and if I have to, I\'ll replace the whole drive line because I have that too. Like I said, I have all these oddball... these useless... I have all these useless parts that are no good to me right now, but if I had a truck...If you had a truck, they\'d be right....I\'d just put them in. It wouldn\'t even have to be running because it would be after I had time, and it wouldn\'t cost me hardly anything, and I would have a much nicer vehicle, more suited to my need. Like my car is nice and all, but it\'s too small.You want something bigger to ride around in?I... yeah. It\'s just that there\'s no room in it. Like, you know, I would like to have a vehicle that I can live in for now. That would really be good.Would you take it camping?Yeah. But you can\'t do that with a car. (chuckles) Well, you can I suppose but...It\'s hard.Yeah. Like right now I can flip bucket seats, fold down, and the whole car\'s like a bed, you know, on the inside. It\'s nice, but then you think, "Now where... where you going to eat?"Pull out the glove compartment. (laughs)Yeah. Yeah. That\'s pretty small. Now a truck would be much better for that, and I\'m glad I\'m not worried about that. I\'m not going to have the chance to go camping for a long time. [:38] ng to try and find some books this week to read.Because you\'re interested in reading now you mean, or what?I\'m devouring everything in the house. It\'s mostly junk, so I said that I better find something that would really stimulate me before I get bored. I\'m Pan. I\'m tuning on the piano too, like kind of [an accomplished player] (ph).It _______________?Yeah. Just like I make up my... most pop songs are basic rhythm pattern, and I just started inventing my own patterns.I was thinking, you know, I don\'t think I have any books you\'d be interested in, but you\'d be... you know, you\'d be... you\'d be welcome to borrow a book if you found something you wanted to read, but I don\'t have much except psychology text books.I don\'t mind those.Well, you can take a look if you\'re interested.I\'ve read a lot of psychology books. Those are them?Um hm.I\'ve always wondered how many books those were. It never occurred to me that you... you could read before you were buying them.They were (right) (ph).Yeah. You did that too. I don\'t know. I\'ve been wanting to... to get a book on the [transactional neurosis] (ph). Kind of new.Yeah. I don\'t have any books on that.Except it\'s too expensive. They haven\'t put it on paperback yet, so we can just wait awhile. It\'s kind of inter... I read a couple of books that were like that. I mean, they were kind of hard to understand, because they\'re a little bit different than the... the regular... than regular... most schools of psychology now.I don\'t know which... you mean the (Eric Burn) (ph) book. Is that what you\'re talking about?I was reading that, yeah. This is by a guy named Harris. It\'s called "I\'m Okay, You\'re Okay". There\'s this guy on the radio on it... on his talk show. He\'s always pushing this book, you know, and for no... see they had that author on one day, and the author\'s really brave, you know, I think. He really has... I think he has a good idea in... in the book and I would like to get the book, but not for five-and-a-half dollars.(laughs)But hey, it was... it\'s a lot like Burn... there\'s some other guy wrote a book like that too. I can\'t remember, but I read it. Oh, well. And I wanted to read "Push Comes to Shove" too.What\'s that "Push Comes to Show"?Yeah, shove. It\'s by..."Push Comes to Shove" (laughs).It\'s... it\'s about campus violence.Oh, never heard of it. [:40]There\'s a... the cover... it\'s really wild. This Harvard student wrote it, and on the front cover there\'s pic... there\'s little symbols of hands, you know, human hands. And the first symbol is the peace symbol, and then... I forget what the second symbol is, you know. It\'s not that important though. About half-way through, it turns into a clenched fist, you know. Then down at the bottom it\'s... it has a - what do you call it? I don\'t know what you call it? It\'s just the middle finger sticking up, you know, like f**k you. "Push Comes to Shove", you know. [Glad you vote for] (ph) traditional hand signals. I mean, I want to... I want to read that. I mean, I think I\'m always getting involved in what\'s going on in the world now more than I was. Maybe it\'s that talk show that\'s affecting me or something because... like I never... everybody talks about the Kent State Massacre and all that. I never knew what was going on, and I didn\'t really care.All of a sudden you\'re getting aware of what\'s going on. Interesting.And, yeah. Last week I read an article in the "Newsweek" about how it was true, you know, and it was the National Guard that shot, you know. They not only shot four people and killed them, but they wounded 11 others, and it kind... it really shook me up, you know. I said, "Oh, God, where have I been?", you know. "What\'s going on here?" People are getting killed and I don\'t even know about it.And here I am sitting in the corner without noticing and not knowing.Yeah. And it\'s listening to that... to that talk show. They really bring a lot of stuff in, and the people that call in are very intelligent. Like they\'re... they not [:33] only have something to say to the moderator, but they... they have information to give out to the people.But you suddenly seem more interested in worrying about it, or you were caught up by the issue.Maybe it\'s just to keep myself from getting bored again. It is interesting the way that... that he puts things, you know. Like his... his (class) (ph) is very much like mine. Maybe it\'s mine. I think so. But you know, he continually can see through the propaganda that people put out now, both radical propaganda and conservative propaganda if there is such a thing. I mean, he\'s always pointing out how... how really assuming the people... the labels people put on each other are. There\'s... there\'s so much that goes with a label, you know, that the label is useless. It\'s not... I don\'t know what... how to... to describe it. It\'s kind of insights in... real good insights into...Perceptive...Yeah....in cutting through things.He can cut through things and separate it and get some of the basic pointers say, "Well, what are you guys fighting about?", you know. "You should be talking about this point instead of fighting with all these stupid words.", you know.Cut through the... all those words to the real issues behind them.Yeah. And at... at first... the first time I listened to that I didn\'t believe that... that was going on and then I raved, you know, "Not in my campus.", but, you know, I couldn\'t believe it, you know. So I listened to the whole show, two hours, and I... I\'m amazed by it all. This... this is phenomenal. I hope this guy... I wonder if they only put... usually when you get something like that, they only put the guy on once or twice and then (inaudible). This guy he\'s every day.Who is this guy? [:58]Stan Dale. [Two little names] (ph) and he shouldn\'t be on any of them.All day.He was saying about how in California on this one radio show it\'s 24 hours continuous talk, and they have five or six different moderators on it, and they mix them up, you know, hawks and doves, and radicals and conservatives and revolutionaries, and the whole bit. And they mix them all up, and it comes out perfect. There\'s... there\'s... they never run out of people to talk to. There\'s always somebody on that line.You know, you\'re talking about listening to this (inaudible) saying anything. Looks like you can really get turned on about intellectual issues, and ideas, and like that really...Uh huh. Especially when the... when they... when they put it so clear, you know. And then some of the people that call in are really... they\'re not clear at all, and it\'s kind of a... a contrast, you know, because then... then I... then I put my brain to work and figure it out what the... what the guy who\'s calling in is really saying...But... and you really enjoy being active.And so... Yeah. And then...Putting your brain to work, yes.And then Stan Dale comes on, you know, and I listen to him and most the stuff he says makes pretty good sense. You don\'t have to stop and figure it out. It\'s right there. It\'s obvious. And I don\'t know... there\'s... there\'s a real attraction there. Maybe... maybe it\'s because there\'s somebody else figuring it out... it out too, you know. It\'s just besides me. Right. It makes me feel like, you know, I\'m not alone in that. There\'s somebody else alive in this world with feelings... (chuckles)Actually it\'s kind of a link between you and that other person.Yeah.Connection.And then on top of it most of the people that call in are really just about as bright, and it gives you a whole new outlook, you know. Like people aren\'t really as stupid as you think they are.Makes you feel optimistic?Maybe the silent majority is, but... because the people that call in aren\'t silenced. What do you call them?The vocal minority.Yeah. That walking really wore me out. It\'s that I had cramps in my legs, you know. I ate something, which was a mistake and it just felt like lead. It wouldn\'t digest. It just kind of flapped in there and I\'m just like... [he woke up the next morning] (ph) and... and the cramps were gone (inaudible) instead. He\'s gone away mad.] (ph) I\'m really dragging.Ready for another danger?Yeah. Well, that\'s... that\'s two (inaudible) you can have. They\'re adventures in a short period of time.Short-term adventures. It\'s about time to stop.Um hm. When is our next meeting?How is...', "All right. So, um, he's been having a bit of a time here.Yeah.UmWell, it hasn't been as important [INAUDIBLE] until he started this new school to be able to stay focused all day.When did he start?[DATE].[DATE]. All right, so [DATE]. All right, so this is the all day, was the other one a half a day?Yeah, he's been a half day in kindergarten, then he went to like a daycare which was no big deal. But this is an all day school.Um, all right. So.And I'll tell you the difference between having the right amount of medication and not is he can do an excellent job versus not being able to do it at all. The same exact task, like adding or, um, you know, pretty much his memory is horrible when he doesn't have it, and his frustration level, and he can't stick with anything. And he can't absorb anything, whereas when he's on the right amount of medication it's amazing. He is just amazing. I mean, in 6 weeks he caught up with, now keep in mind this is a gifted school, so he caught up with the other kids had done in his group, over a half a course of the year which means he's halfway through a first grade math book. He's halfway through the first grade math book and I taught him, we taught him that within 6 weeks. As you can imagine, I mean, the kid's smart.Yeah.Input output is the same thing with out. If you can get him where he needs to be, you know, so he, um, he needs some stability. And what, you know, what's happening is [INAUDIBLE]. So, umSo you did a couple things.We did a couple things. One was he moved up the timing of the, initially moved up the timing of the 5 mg and it worked, but, um, it wasn't [INAUDIBLE]. And so then we were dosing him with the 10 mg and then it wouldn't last as long as because we were giving it to him like at 11:00. So it wouldn't last long. Then you said to go to, and I haven't tried this yet, I wanted to start them this week on this to give him 2 at 11:00 so it would be 10 mg at 11:00, and then another 5 at like 1:30. That was a suggestion you had.All right. Yeah, that was the later, the February.It is difficult for them to give 2 doses, um, but they're willing to try, it's just remembering.All right, so you're going to, I guess they can't do that without a prescription. Anyway.Right. I wanted to wait for an order from you today. But I told them that that was coming. I've done it at home.So you want, um, 10 mg at 11:00 a.m. and 5 mg at 2:00?One to 2 I think is the, I don't know if you can do that on a prescription.Yeah. I mean, I think if, 15.That's 2 hours later.Yeah, it's almost like we could, if that works, then it's, sounds like we could do 20 at 11:00, 20 in the morning and 20 at 11:00.How long would it last? And that's the other issue. At home he can't do anything because by then it's gone. And he does need to do a little extra work at home and the only time I can do it is on the weekends. So I don't know if we should worry about that right now.Well, is he taking the regular Focalin? Well, what time are you home, when he gets home, what time's he get home?I pick him up at 3:00.So he could do some work in the afternoon.He could do a little bit if he had the medication [INAUDIBLE] him, but I also [INAUDIBLE] sleep, right.Yeah. I mean, but if we gave him, umGive him 20, it'd last longer.Yeah, but let's not do that yet. Let's do 3, umBecause he takes the initial 20 at like 7:30 in the morning, and so that's getting him through 2:00, after, if he takes it after 11:00 he's falling off. If he takes it around 11:00 the next dose is maintained. So what is that 5 hours?Yeah. Okay. Um, all right, so, um, this would be the XR. And then, uh, well, it lasts for, what, 4 1/2, the 20, to 11:30, something like that?Probably. I mean, it probably has, it definitely taper, the impulsivity and the focus are the first to go. He's not hyper then, but those 2 are the first 2 go. They notice it with things like speaking out a lot instead of being able to raise his hand, impatience goes up, frustration level comes quicker.Um.He's had a couple of outbursts too though.Really?Yeah, they made me come get him one day.Oh my god.It scared me 'cause I didn't want him getting kicked out.Yeah. Um.So his new, and it probably follows, it probably does follow the medication. It's hard to say.Um, all right. So, you know, basically, um, but overall I mean mood is much more stable than it was before. I mean, from way back in the beginning.I tell you what's better is just the not mood so much, the impulsivity and, yeah, I mean, just ability to do things. Um, that's what's a lot better. Ability to be who he is, be, he still has these temper tantrums so to speak, you know, this sort of yelling. Um, so I think he has a better ability to like go to a teacher and get help than before he might have just acted out and clobbered somebody. But I'm not sure [INAUDIBLE].All right, so if we do the Focalin XR at 20 mg, one in the morning, and 5 mg, 2 at 11:00 a.m., and then at 1:00 p.m., set it for 1:00? One thirty?Yeah, that's fine, somewhere around there.I mean, if it's one thirty, if we give him 10 at 11:00 maybe we should do 1:30 and hopefully something will still be working when he's home, when he first gets home. UmWhy not give him the 15 all at once 'cause just to spread it out?Yeah, we can do that. Do you want to do that, that actually might be, that would be a lot easier.It's a lot easier on the teachers and the school.All right. Now do you want me to give you some regular, um, Focalin if you want to experiment with it a little bit? Yeah, like a short acting stuff to, um, it comes in 2.5, 5, I'll give you the 5's.Yeah, because like there might be things, you know, like if he wants to play baseball or something and that goes a little later in the evening.Yeah.Or he says he wants to take piano, so he'd have to be able to focus during that timeframe.Um.This is all frontal lobe stuff, right?Yeah, I mean, pretty much. It's, um, uh, it's, um, a lot of, I mean, I'm just, has he ever been, he's never been on Strattera was he?No.All right. Well during the mornings he's not behaviorally, it's like a, it is bad.It's really bad in the morning. You can't get him to get his socks on, you literally have to almost put his clothes on him for him because he just [INAUDIBLE] and all of this is worse since he's been on the medication. It's like when he's off he will literally [INAUDIBLE] jump up and down like a monkey [INAUDIBLE] like this and swing this while he's talking to you. Like a lemur.Worse than no medicine?It's worse than when he didn't take medicine, so now that he's on medication, when he's off the medicine that's part is worse than when he never took medicine before.It's not that it just looks worse in comparison? It really is?I know, I thought about that. I don't think so. I'm not sure I could have tolerated. I'm not sure, you never know what you can tolerate while you're doing it, right? Um, it's pretty bad though. It's bad. It's completely, 2 completely different kids. Unbelievably. You know, before I used to say it's like, okay, I can't leave him, I can't leave him. When he's like that, you can't leave him, you cannot leave him.No. Um, all right. So Focalin XR, um, 20 mg and then 15 mg. You're in [DEIDENTIFIED] right?Uh-huh.Okay. What do IOh, what school wise?Yeah.He's in a private school in [DEIDENTIFIED].[INAUDIBLE] form?That's fine. It doesn't really matter as long as they have something from you.Um, this yeah.If it says the county public school just cross that out and put [DEIDENTIFIED] and initial it.Okay. I'll make a copy. So let me get you the, um, now the regular stuffAnd I want you to weigh him too.Yeah.His brother is half a head taller again, and it wasn't like that, so I mean somebody could have had a growth spurt, butYeah. All right. Says one, you can try a quarter or a half the first couple times to make sure that's okay. Here are these guys. And, um, I'll do this. And let me, how old is he?[AGE].[AGE]. Find out in a minute what he weighs. How tall is he?I don't know.Hm?I don't know.Okay. Um, we'll figure that out. All right, so last time I saw you, yeah, it wasAt what point, what are the things that I would look for to understand talking to you about whether we thought Abilify would be something that he would benefit from?Well, that's a good question.If I see a mood, you know.There's definitely, yeah, he'sMood stability.Right. And he's not so defiant, he's just, it's just not possible, yeah, but, um, it's different. I mean, it might be, but then again perhaps we could try Strattera which is a nonstimulant and see if that will work around the clock some so when he gets up he might be able to function a little better. You hate it?That didn't work.Yeah.As well as the older one.Um.I hate to put him on that and pull him off this.No, no, no, not pull him off this. This works.Oh, I see what you mean.Just adding some.I gotcha, okay, all right, I wouldn't object to that.No, I wouldn't pull him off.I just, you know, it is tough on him too to go up and down.Oh my god.He's very aware of himself in that he knows and he feels, he'll tell you he feels bad.Yeah. All right. Let's see. So [INAUDIBLE]. You want to come here for a second, buddy? All right, hop on, 43.8, ohh. Um, that's good. That's basically.Maybe he's gotten a little taller. [INAUDIBLE].All right.But I look at his, used to be where he weighed more than his brother.Geez.And his brother was taller. And now he weighs less and is shorter.Yeah.He's slow, I don't know if that's a natural slowing or if it's [INAUDIBLE].Um, okay. Let's do a month again just to see.Yeah, we have it set up for a month.You do already?Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].Okay. All right. Let's, um, [INAUDIBLE]", 'Sorry I\'m late, traffic is getting worse.Yeah, I\'m sure this is a horrible time to have to get somewhere.Sometimes I wish you\'d start it out.[inaudible 0:00:41] just sitting there.Just really too unstructured. Like in order to say anything or to talk about anything there has to be some kind of context in which we discuss it in that context. it\'s kind of in a way, a similar feeling, but not as bad, as just when I come in with a new group of people and they\'re talking about something and I don\'t fit in. And I just feel like not saying anything because it\'s really hard. And you asked me at one point on Tuesday, if when I was feeling like I felt... I was feeling this really bad way when there\'s more [inaudible 0:02:10] group of people. If someone had come up to me and said, "What\'s wrong? Could I have told?" And I couldn\'t think then, if I could\'ve I\'m not. I said that I\'m pretty sure that I couldn\'t have, because in a lot of ways, this situation here is one in which I can talk. So far I\'ve felt pretty comfortable talking. And yet I realize that Monday night, I didn\'t want to come here Tuesday. Like I really didn\'t want to come on Tuesday, but by Tuesday I was ok.But like this would be part of that feeling of not being able to...It was like I didn\'t want to talk to anybody. I didn\'t want to talk to you.Are you saying something like... the image that came to my mind was breaking in, when you\'re sitting with a bunch of people, you really have to take so much energy to break in. And I was wondering if sometimes you thought you had to push your way in here too.Mmhmm.I\'m not sure into what.Well, into whatever should be talked about. Because I really... It is sort of that I can\'t remember whatever we ended on last time, which would probably provide an opening but I can never remember it. And... What was I going to say?Do you feel at all as though I have some idea about what it might be that we should talk about that I\'m not ...No, I don\'t feel that at all. I wish you did, that\'s the whole thing. Because it is kind of like the whole entry thing keeps swirling around. A whole lot of times, depending on the situation I\'m in, one thing will be rubbing me bad and another time another thing will be. I don\'t know that focusing on any of them is going to do me good. I don\'t know if anything should be focused on, or just talk.You\'re saying like it would help to feel you were going somewhere, maybe. [0:05:08]Probably.Because you\'re saying about wishing you could take off where you left off, if only to start. But I was wondering if that also felt like there would be some continuity to it. That it is like fragmenting the talk about one rub and then another and then another.Yeah. I also don\'t remember what I talked about. Because there will be times if I\'m really absorbed in something, something is going to bother me. But I can\'t remember whether I told you about it or not. And I wouldn\'t have thought about it or dreamed about it or whatever.I\'m not sure whether you\'re saying that and just saying, "ok, I know this is how it is but still this is how it makes me feel." Or whether there\'s some sense of, "look, I really don\'t like this and I wish I could change it in some way. Or I wish I could do something different." I\'m not really sure...I guess I\'m trying, I\'m kind of saying all that. I guess too, just debating about what I feel comfortable talking to you about. Like I get really tired of saying the same things, not being able to control my moods, which has happened a lot of the time when we talk. Because just saying it doesn\'t get me anywhere as far as doing anything about it. Or understanding it. [0:07:36] I think there are times when I don\'t really want to talk. And some senses when I\'m really depressed, I don\'t have the energy to write, or talk, or anything else. It is just everything requires too much energy. Like why bring up feelings that are there and be [inaudible phrase 0:08:30]Are you saying why bring them out and really look at them when they may end up hurting you more?Well, let\'s see.Sounds like just toward the end there, and go ahead after this if you want, I just wanted to say that it sounds like you\'re feeling kind of bitter about where you saw yourself at this point. I was wondering...I don\'t know what you mean by that.Well, when you were talking about some of the things that make it hard for you to talk or make it confusing, it sounded like you were feeling sort of... kind of disgusted with that, or disgusted with feeling that you\'ve been working on some things and haven\'t changed them or why bring them up and...Sometimes. I don\'t know, I just... My aunt called me this morning about 8:00 and said she was going to kill herself. And I sort of hung up on her. That was [inaudible phrase 0:10:06] And when she was fighting, there have just been a whole lot of bad things going on there and I was just really tired of hearing about them. I mean, I knew she really felt like killing herself, and it was going to be because her boyfriend had left her. I guess what scared me about it was, when driving to work, was that\'s part of the reason I feel like killing myself all the time, not feeling rejected so much, it is just I\'m not being, "alright he left me therefore I\'ll kill myself, that rotten person I\'ll show him." It is much more of a, "they\'ve got their own lives and I don\'t fit in with them, therefore I\'ll kill myself." And it is in a sense a different reason, but it is still the same thing that because I can\'t get things my way or the way that I need to have them, that\'s going to be the out that I\'ll take. And it just makes me really mad because she is the last person I want to identify with. Almost makes me feel like I have to go out of my way not to feel hurt when my boyfriend doesn\'t feel like I feel like he should. Which in a sense why last night, when he came over, it was very nice. [0:11:34]There was no conversation. It was like, he was just there. And I didn\'t dare bring up anything that was important or significant or anything else. And then when I drove him home, he asked if I wanted to play Bridge on Saturday night, which is one thing that we usually enjoy doing together, and somehow that was just another way of being together without talking. And I usually really enjoy Bridge because it gets my mind off things and it is really a fun thing to do. And I said no. That was the last thing I felt like doing in that moment, but I\'d let him know if I change my mind. But at that point I was just deciding, "look, I can\'t stand this emotional... I\'ve got to have some expression of feeling, not maintaining this nice, cold, civil image of myself in this relationship." But it is too emotional for that. If it is not going to be emotional then I just... the heck with it. I just got to get away. Get out of it.So you\'re saying, "if there\'s nothing for me in being self-contained and in part." Everything is going on that level at this point.Mmhmm. I mean, if there can be more than that, then sure you can have a very good time doing superficial things, but if that\'s all there is, then I\'d just as soon play cards with perfect strangers. It would be about as meaningful. At that point I was just really considering it, except that it is freezing outside, just taking my dog and going camping. Mostly because I really don\'t want to face this weekend. I don\'t want to face it with him or without him. Without any kind of nice structured thing to do. Because I kind of know if I stay here, I\'ll wish I was away. Or else I have that great Bridge game to work from. Man, that\'s not what I want. In a sense just doing that would probably be the worst thing in the world for me. [0:14:31]Like last night, we had a dinner, just very informal my roommate and her boyfriend and my boyfriend and another roommate. It was unplanned and it went so well. I sort of ran the whole thing, and cooked and joined in the conversation and felt perfectly comfortable with everybody. Which is like the opposite side of me from the side that sits and withdrawals and feels like she doesn\'t fit in with anything. That kind of situation in a sense is the best thing in the world for me, and withdrawing from people completely is never going to put me in that situation. I was thinking last night when I was thinking about, kind of planning this camping trip, because I could just take of from work tomorrow and leave, that it might be a fantastic thing if I got really interested and just ran along the beach with the dog and stuff that I\'d feel really good. But also just sitting by myself and not talking to anybody, I could just really easily want to kill myself out there. I was sort of having these parallel thoughts, because how am I going to get my dog back home if I kill myself, because I can\'t leave her alone and stuff like that.It was like somehow I had to get away, and I didn\'t really care what happened, or where I went. Not a very well planned kind of thing. It was just sort of an option, and therefore just seize it. But I don\'t want to.Felt kind of like rushing away from a lack of structure, and then it sounds like finding yourself threatened with another kind of lack of structure almost.Well it would be not necessarily a lack of structure, because I can enjoy just sitting outside. Sitting in the rain, or walking or anything like that, that\'s fine. But just the deliberate separation of myself from human beings when I should probably be spending my time at least meeting some new people around here, and sort of doing something to get myself out of the rut from being dependent on my boyfriend, who I can\'t talk to. Really what I need right now is a really good friend that I can share things with.A friend...Yeah, that it is just a very mutual relationship that I\'ve got with people that are spread at various points in this country. That are just really good friends. But they\'re not here, so in a sense I should be going out and trying to establish some relationships with people, but I\'m too busy running. [0:17:52]And also at some level it sounds to me like formulating the task like that or at that level makes it a hell of a thing to try and do. I\'m not sure if that\'s clear but it\'s like saying, "I have to go meet people." It is like... It leaves me with a sense of imperative, that it is something I need to do, but nothing says I can do this to go there, or I can do this to go and approach it. Am I clear in what I\'m saying?You mean as far as actual steps to get there that are clear and obvious and easy?Well, not only that, but I guess I was thinking just formulating them in that way, to me, makes things like that seem even bigger, or even more impossible. Like saying, "well, I know what the trouble is and now I have to go do some X and X is maybe something that\'s been hard all my life," and putting in a big lump like that makes it impossible, or feel impossible anyway.The thing is, it is not impossible, but I just don\'t want to do it. I mean, I just really don\'t have the energy to do it.OK.I mean, somehow, something inside me really wants to destroy me. To go out and meet people and to forget about my boyfriend will in a lot of ways save me, and somehow I don\'t have the energy to do that even though I know that\'s the right thing to do. There\'s something, I don\'t know whether its... some of it is that I won\'t be able to succeed, but that\'s not all of it. Some of it, in some ways I will succeed. There are a couple of guys that I got to partially know this summer when my boyfriend when my boyfriend was out of town, that I\'d really like to see again. I just got a message today that one of them wants me to call him. That would really help, but then there\'s this part of me that doesn\'t want to talk to anybody. Especially somebody that I like, and want to establish a good friendship with, I don\'t want them to know this part of me, that\'s just really out of it. [0:20:25]So it is like you\'re saying, "Look it isn\'t a matter of steps, I know how to take the steps. The real struggle is inside me, I\'m the one that\'s making it impossible for me to do it." I don\'t know how that battle is going to go.There are people that I could begin seeing, and it would be easy to make contact with them, and find things to do with them, but I\'ve go to have "Me" to present to them and be with them, and I don\'t know who that Me is going to be. I don\'t like the one that is there now. Has been for the most part. It is that same kind of thing that, I will not write my very best friends, because somehow I feel that I\'m not the kind of person that I\'d like to be. One thing I was thinking of doing if I care about them is to write all these letters. One thing I realized is that I can go camping with all these letters I have left to answer from last year. And unless I feel extremely high, and good and things like that, I\'m not going to be able to write to a single person. Because I\'m not going to want them to have to listen to me. I mean, I wouldn\'t write about anything that was wrong or anything else, I just simply couldn\'t write to them.It sounds like it is just this total thing, and you can\'t even bring yourself to communicate when you feel like that.I don\'t want to communicate when I feel like that. It is like it is really ironic in a way, but every single one of my very best friends has gotten married this year. My best friend that I grew up with I guess had a baby in the middle of September, but I just heard about it last night, when talking to my mom. And the reason I just heard about it is because she wrote me last April. I was the maid of honor in a wedding in March, and we have known each other since we were four and we\'ve always been very close. She moved to Mexico in March and wrote me when she got there and told me about the expected baby, and was all sorts of happy and sent me a birthday present. And I have not been able to write to send her a thank you for the present, to send her a wedding present, a baby present, to send her a card even for her own birthday. I wrote her half of a letter at some point, half of a letter and I felt good. I felt bad after that and I was never able to finish it. And I\'m still not.Her mother is kind of my adopted mother now, because her mother is looking after my aunt, and I\'ve taken on her address as my permanent address. And I hear from her mother all the time, and her mother keeps writing me things like, "why don\'t you write my daughter?" And I can\'t do it. It is a really horrible feeling, and a lot of it stems from the fact that... Well, it is kind of with all of them, each person that has gotten married or is about, this one guy I grew up with at the same time who is just like a brother to me, I just found out also last night that he\'s getting married in December, and I\'m really happy. But at this point I don\'t think I can write to him. It is like somehow each of them have established in some ways a really happy life and I\'m really glad for them. Somehow I\'m just this person that, because I haven\'t found any kind of a happy life at all, and don\'t know that I ever will, I feel like I can\'t join them in their happiness because I\'m not a solid person myself [0:25:05]Is there something about this, this is truly effecting you, is there something that there is a feeling that you will sully this happiness of theirs, or that you would make it go sour a little bit?Somehow I won\'t add to it. I mean, people... When you\'re really happy about something you don\'t go up... If you\'ve got a boyfriend and you\'re in college, you don\'t go up this girl in your hall that never has any dates and you don\'t go up to her and tell her how happy that you\'ve got new boyfriend. And it is that kind of thing that, that would only make you unhappy and guilty because you\'ve got something you don\'t have. And until I\'m really happy myself and don\'t have to be somebody that they have to ask how things are gong with, or... Then it\'s like I really do much, much better to just stay away from them, in every sense of the word, just have no contact with them at all. Letter-wise, or anything else. Part of it, I guess, is that I feel this way toward absolutely everyone, except maybe this one girl who I was also maid-of-honor at her wedding in July, I\'ve maintained pretty good contact with her, better than everyone else. Somehow I feel like I can give something to her, and I can talk to her about how she feels and she\'ll talk to me and be really open. [0:27:00]It sounds like some of that is almost like, "If I try to communicate with some of these people who are happy, they\'re going to have to protect me, they\'re going to have to think about what they say to me, they\'re going to have to check up on me and see if I can take it almost. They\'ll sense that I don\'t know whether pity is relevant here, but that they\'ll have to treat me like a weak sister sort of."Just being with them a lot of times I just feel like I\'m floating away. It is nice to see me, but I can\'t really offer them anything. And it is not like I never go to them and complain about how things are and everything else, and I think if you asked any of them, they wouldn\'t feel that way. They wouldn\'t feel like I didn\'t want to see them, or that I was a moping complaining person to have around the house or something. But on the other hand, I feel like unless I feel really deeply secure or anything else, than the happiness I put on is really a superficial kind of thing. I don\'t think it comes across this way, but somehow it is not totally me. It is like acting a role or something like that. And if I\'m with people who are really close friends, and I\'ve been really lucky having guys and girls both that I\'m talking about now are all girls that I\'m talking about. I mean that are just marvelous, marvelous people and would do anything in the world for me, and that kind of thing. And because I really value their friendship, and because I really would like some kind of total relationship with them as far as being really open about talking and really knowing where each other stands and feels and that kind of thing. I can\'t do it. I mean, I\'m really hesitant right now to see this one girl that I\'m closest to. It is just so much easier to go back in the woods someplace and be a hermit. [0:29:43]Something about, I hear you saying, "They might be really willing to receive me, to hear about what my problem is, what I\'m worrying about, or how I\'m feeling about this self of mine," but there sounds like there is something in you that has to feel you can participate in a certain way or else it is not, sounds like another kind of impossibility. There\'s something that just keeps you from doing it. What would, sometimes these questions are hard to answer, what would be the consequence for you, how would you feel if you spent a weekend with one of these people and you felt that that bad self was pretty evident. That you couldn\'t help pick it up at some point, that you couldn\'t cover it up.I don\'t know. It somewhat happened, this friend in Madison, because I\'ve been able to see her a lot. Also she\'s the one that just got married last month and I used to be able to go up and stay with her. For a while it was fine, because she and I were both going through the same thing, not being completely happy with where we were, and not knowing where we were going and each of us having all these kind of romantic ideas about things that we\'d like to do and going off. We\'d just have a great time just talking about them. But now that\'s all off. Because I\'m still back there, but she\'s not. And I really have trouble just finding things to talk to her about. [0:31:40]We are just on different levels, we\'re not going through the same kinds of things. This girl that is in Mexico now, and had a baby in September, partially, I\'m so fantastically jealous of her, and yet happy for her. I don\'t know whether she feels this or not. We used to both talk when we were kids how we each wanted to have ten kids. We were both only children, so we both were like sisters growing up- she had a brother that died when she was very little- and we each wanted a farm and raise ten kids and hundreds of animals. This was like our dream. And she still has it and I still have it...And she has a part of it really now.And she can still get it and I don\'t feel like I can. I just feel like I\'ve got to let her live her life. It is like I really wish I could visit her and somehow not be me, somehow get out of myself and really be able to join in on her plane.And take that part of you along that can really share that dream and say, "I really am glad that you\'ve got part of it." But you\'re saying you would have to take that jealous part along too. Or at least you would have to take the feelings with you, and that... [0:33:46]I\'d have to take all of me along, and right now all of me is really pretty much of a failure, at anything. A failure being not reaching what you consider valuable. I couldn\'t do that. Because I wouldn\'t be able to talk to her. And I really thought about doing this internship in Mexico, just to see them, just to be around them. I love her husband, he\'s really marvelous. They\'re the kind of people I could really have a lot of fun with if I could just keep myself from getting depressed. And if I could just bring myself to talk to her or get her to talk to me on some kind of an open level. But I can\'t. And she\'s not the kind of person who will really open up to you unless you\'re really open. Which I\'m not.I guess the reason I\'ve stayed in contact with this one girl, that is now in New Hampshire that I was the closest to I guess. She\'ll come out and ask me, and she\'s really open herself. She\'ll explore every kind of feeling under the sun, and talk about absolutely anything with you, and let you know what she really feels about it herself. It is not you\'re crying on her shoulder, it is the two of you discussing things like, what is it like to be tied down to one man, and what should you do with all of your really good male friends, what are the values of life that you\'re heading toward and that kind of thing. [0:35:43] What it is that worries you about things that are going on in your family and things like that. There are things that she would bring up that I would never bring up. But that because she brings them up I can talk to her about them, and end up laughing with her and both of us feeling really good about it. But I can\'t do that with any of these other friends. I\'m sure a lot of my own mannerisms turn them off, and really make them afraid to ask, "How are you?"Like what?Because I\'m not willing to start talking about how I\'m feeling or what\'s bothering me or anything else. They\'ll just, they\'re in a sense afraid to ask what\'s going on because I\'m going to try to pass it off. Like if they say, "How are you?" I\'m going to say, "Fine." What\'s been going on this year of life and working and just doing very superficial things.They\'ll know it or sense it maybe, and you certainly know it, and you don\'t think you can do anything about it and that leaves you...I mean, just knowing that it is so hard for me to say anything else, or so hard fro me to talk about how I really feel, which it is, and which is very evident if they ever ask me about how I felt, would make them really afraid to ask or just talk about basic "what\'s going on?" kind of things.I\'m wondering, and I realize in some ways this is probably a very different situation but, I\'m wondering what it does to you to come here and talk about what you\'re talking about. What is the self-love that you bring here?I don\'t know. It varies.Are there days... Have there been days or times when you\'ve minded what you\'ve brought in here? Like you would have like to gone in some different way?Sometimes.I guess I\'m wondering if I\'ve seen any of what you\'re talking about.Not so much. Somewhat. Some things have been very hard. sometimes I\'ve talked about the least important things to avoid talking about other things.What\'s in that? There are all kinds of reasons people don\'t want to talk about things. Is it similar to what you\'re talking about with your friends? [0:39:05]I don\'t know what it amounts to.Are you feeling pressed by these questions? Am I pushing too hard?No, the questions don\'t bother me. I just don\'t know the answer. I\'m feeling depressed about the reality, to be honest, that I\'ve just described. It is really too bad, because people are really the most important thing to me in the world. I\'d flunk exams and term papers and everything else if I could spend time talking to someone that had a problem. Close friends are the most important thing to me, like really close friends. I tend to be really far from somebody or really close to somebody. I don\'t have that many just sort of buddies. I never have. I have a few really close friends that sort of go everywhere with me, or do everything with me and everyone else was just stranger, or just about a stranger. I guess I feel like I\'m losing all of my really close friends because of me. I\'m losing the possibility of getting any others.I\'ve lived through beginning my second year in living with four girls in this house and I don\'t know any of them. It is like we\'re really strangers.It is almost like you\'re saying, "how can that happen? If people are so important, how can that happen that I can cut myself off like that?" Is that something I\'m saying that you\'re not saying?I\'m not asking how it can happen, I\'m saying it happened. I went kind of through the same kind of things with a group of high school friends I had at this one high school I went to. It was fantastic, it was a whole group that sort of took me in when I moved there, and I became really good friends with some of them. [0:42:04]Then I moved away and at first, when I would go back, I\'d call all of them, and we\'d get together and have a really good time. The last time I was down there, I went because my aunt had died, and the whole family ended up staying there for a while to finish up all sorts of family affairs. And somehow I felt really good then, that was the first fall I was here, and I was still really liking this place and I was still really up. I had just gotten back from Europe and I was going to make it in New York on my own, I was really looking forward to it. I felt like I could do anything under the sun. When I went to Knoxville, when I finally got over my Aunt\'s death, which took a while, I still felt strong. In a lot of ways it was like I was taking over and taking care of the whole family. And I was a benefit to everybody there and I was looking over my little brother. I was... My Aunt had never had any kids, I was her heir. She left everything to me and in a sense I was her substitute daughter. My grandmother knew this and so somehow having me there was a really good thing, because she knew how much my Aunt had loved me, and just kind of having me there to support her and to do things, take care of anything that needed to be done. I felt useful both practically, in taking care of what needed to be done and in negotiating with my Aunt\'s husband, who the family didn\'t get along with that well, and trying to keep harmony between them, which I managed to do very well. Everyone thought it was going to be a horrible thing to have to do. Somehow I managed to keep things both practically and emotionally, and to just fill everybody\'s needs and just be myself. And before that week was over with, by the time I finished being really necessary in my family, I called most of my girlfriends. Most of them had moved away, but I called their mothers and find out what they were doing and everything. I had the best time, just getting acquainted again, with the girls themselves, or with their parents and finding out what they were doing. And I was all set to write all of them and sort of reestablish talks, simply because I felt good about me. I could write them, and I still really do value all their friendships, but I left, and I got depressed after I left and so it\'s like things went steadily down hill after that. And I could no longer write it down, anything.It is not because it is easy to procrastinate and stuff like that, but the thing is that I would really like to write them back, or see them. And I don\'t even feel like seeing them. [0:45:49.4]Well it sounds like there\'s just a total difference between how you were there and how you felt about yourself and how you are now. It is like there\'s no... well, let\'s see. I\'m not sure what I mean. It sounds like you\'re just feel like a totally different person.The fact is, both people are there and they\'ve always been there. There was a long period before this particular fall that I had trouble taking to the girls down there. When I\'ve gone back a couple of times, I\'ve gone back for these particular operations that I didn\'t particularly... I didn\'t even want them to know that I was there for, that I felt really, really bad about. So those times I\'d be in town for weeks and I wouldn\'t call any of them. So it is not like before everything was good and now everything is bad. There have been a lot of times when it has been good and when it has been bad. Most times it has been bad. but the possibility is there that it can be good, and every once in a while something will trigger something and things will go really well and I\'ll be really close to these people again, and we\'ll establish close friendships or something like that.Do you have a sense for what those things are that make it better or worse? Or is it totally unpredictable? [0:47:26]When I have an occasion to feel good about myself, the way I described that week with family when I was on top of the world about everything. I was optimistic about what I was going to do, I had some sort of plan about my studies and I felt good about myself and my abilities and my emotions. I just felt like a really whole person, a successful person. Not that I had really an success in sort of material terms to do, I didn\'t have a job that I was all of a sudden in, or anything else, I was still looking around. But I felt good about myself and I was optimistic with looking around, it wasn\'t that I\'d found something or anything else. This kind of whole gestalt of feelings just permitted me to reach out and want to reach out to everybody. You know, whenever I feel really good I want to find some friend of mine and say, "look, this is a really good thing and share this with me." But if things are really bad I don\'t want to talk to anybody and as a result I don\'t write to people and they think I don\'t care about them, and you know that\'s not the mark of a very good friend.From their point of view I could think, they must think, "She really cares less, she gets into her own world and doesn\'t care about her friends anymore." I don\'t know how to explain to them otherwise. It is easier not to try.[0:49:21]There\'s no way to tell them, "I\'d like to be with you now, except there are times when I can\'t. I don\'t want you to feel that I don\'t care about you, because I do, but I can\'t come."Because I can\'t even write and I can\'t talk. And the reason to convey anything would be the fact that I wasn\'t in good shape myself right now, which is not something that I want to convey. Because then all of a sudden I\'m this person to be treated delicately because they don\'t understand what\'s going on. And I\'m a person to be worried about, and that\'s not exactly the kind of relationship I want to have with anybody.It\'s like there\'s no kind of dignity or strength in saying something like, "I want be by myself, there are times when I want to be by myself. I don\'t want to talk to anybody." You feel like to indicate anything at all those people would take you as really needing something you don\'t want. I don\'t know if it is pity, I don\'t know if that struck anything to you or not, but it is a word that keeps occurring to me.It is a word I feel like that it is an emotion that if they start talking to me, they\'re going to feel like they should feel. Which I don\'t wan them to feel.That is very degrading or whatever.It sure can.Almost like being depersonalized. Like you\'re in pain.I really got to make it on my own somehow before I can... I have got to make it as a strong person before I come back to them and I don\'t know if I can do it. I don\'t know if by that time they\'ll even want to see me again.[0:51:41]That like in doing what you feel is necessary you not only hurt yourself, but then again, you give yourself this impression of something that you really don\'t intend. You don\'t intend to push these people away.I remember really clearly this girl saying to me, in this group that I was in, and she was one that I considered a pretty close friend in my class, and we were going around telling what we thought of each other, and she said, "I don\'t know. You really frighten me because you seem to have so many problems they really scare me. And I don\'t know what to do." Like in a sense, they touched on her problems that she couldn\'t cope with and it made her afraid to come in contact with me at all, because she was afraid that I was really going through so much. Not that I\'d even said to her that I was going through anything at all.Like somehow that emanated from you with a force that really frightened her.Like she had visited me a few times in the hospital, the last week I was there, recovering. A couple of springs ago. She\'s call me at first when I went in there I was really fine. She\'d call me and say, "How are you?" And I would say, "Fine." She wanted to know what was wrong with me and I wouldn\'t tell her and that got her really upset. She\'d keep asking me, "Is it this, is it this?" "No it isn\'t, please don\'t worry about me, or come to see me or anything like that, I\'ll come to see you when I get out."And sort of ever since them, just because I would be physically sick after that, which I was, I was never quite the same strong person in my relationship to her. And I realized just because I had things that I was worried about, it just really upset her, and she just couldn\'t take it. It made her really not want to talk to me and in fact, she hasn\'t talked to me very much at all. I\'ve gotten so that I don\'t want to talk to her at all, just because I know how I come across to her. [0:54:09]And I don\'t want to do this to my friends that are really good friends that I\'ve had for a long time. I don\'t want to do this to them.You don\'t want to overwhelm them or something and disappoint them almost. Pushing yourself away.That\'s what I feel like. Unless I\'m a really strong person that can cope with anything, which I can\'t right now, I mean I can not really, really I\'m just truly a mess. I can\'t face them.It has to be how you see yourself, and however you\'re presenting yourself that day. Or whatever you look like on the outside. It sounds like right now it is not anything anyone can do for you. It has to be how you see yourself.Yes.I don\'t want to cut you off, but we have to stop.Yeah, I can see by the clock.', "[PATIENT NAME] you've been coming for a while and you and I have established some medications and a treatment plan that has been relatively effective in keeping you out of the hospital.That's correct.Because you've had some really significant recurrent depressions and manias.Uh-huh.When did this all start [PATIENT NAME]? How old were you?14Age 14.14And can you recall the specifics of that first episode?Like a learned helplessness.And what other symptoms were you having?Despair, no way out.Were you suicidal at that time?I didn't really understand it, I just, it was like a learned helpless.Elaborate on it, what do you mean by that?Like no matter what I could do at that time there wasn't a sport or an activity or anything that would take, you know, internal pain away.The pain was a result of what?Broken family.Changes in moods?Yeah, changes in mood, not understanding. Really just not understanding.Now what changes in mood would you describe?Inferiority, if that's the right word.Describe how you felt.Lack of purpose.Okay. So, lacking direction.Uh-huh.How about your level of functioning, you were a very effective businessman at one time.I couldn't concentrate.Anything else? Were you able to function?No.How were you functioning before this episode? Now this is at age 14 now, you're doing well considering, that's a long time ago.My grandmother used to take me for rides around the country, she, I used to go to work with her at the [DEIDENTIFIED] and you know it was more or less band-aids, taking my mind off, you know, whatever I was going through at the time. I would just, I don't know how to explain it. She just tried to pick up the pieces.But what happened that you were hospitalized? Something must have changed rather dramatically.I would wander off, you know, the neighborhood, just disappear without differentiating time, you know, I would just come back late at night. My mom was livid, so...Were you confused?I wouldn't say I was confused, I just, you know, time could, I could just be gone and not realize it had been 3 hours or 4 hours.And what would you do during this course of time?Just walk. You know, go, this was in [DEIDENTIFIED]. I would, you know, take a walk in the, it's not a park, you know, they have big creeks....Uh-huh.You just take a walk and I think just, it's like being on a feather, you know, just going into my own world.Being on a feather?Yeah, I don't know, just dreaming.As if you were kind of lost or disconnected from life?Uh-huh.The world or what, tell me?Just imagining, you know, what it would be like if things were okay at the time, if my parents were together.And all these symptoms were occurring at the time when your parents were divorcing?Well, I had a step dad at the time, yeah.Okay but what precipitated the hospitalization, something must have changed?All of the triggers were in school, you know, the failing...So you were declining...Right.Academically?Yes.You're a bright guy so something must have changed pretty dramatically for you to start a downward spiral...Yeah.Academically.It's hard to remember.Okay, all right. What actually precipitated a hospitalization?My mom told me that I was going to be evaluated. She said it would be just a few days, ended up being a month.Were you pretty ill in the hospital? Was your mind playing tricks on you?No, I was just severely depressed.To the point of not caring whether you lived or died?Probably, I didn't want to die.So you didn't have any distinct plan, wanting to take your life?I don't think anybody ever naturally wants to die.Well when you're depressed your judgement is affected.Right, I'm sure. I don't think I was, just lost.And that experience was approximately a month. Was medications employed in your management?No.Therapy?Just more observation. I think that's all they did.So they discharged you approximately a month later?Uh-huh.And then what happened? Was there follow up?No.No follow up.No.Did they give you a diagnosis?Mild depression.Mild depression?Uh-huh.Okay. When did the serious depressions and the marked changes in your personality occur afterwards? You were 14, now you're what historically?[AGE]. Wait say that again?You were 14 then and now you're moving to the next episode.Okay.Chronologically, okay?I ended up just making different friends, I think a lot of it was masked through activities, sports, I played lacrosse, I went skiing, I surfed, it was just a big vacation. I think whatever family I had at the time employed all their efforts to, you know, to disguise the truth, but I don't have an operational definition of what that is.I'm not sure what you mean by that.All right, you know, I never really knew what my mom or what my dad, any of these people, had in mind for me at the time. You know, I didn't know what their, I didn't really understand, I was just kept in the dark.Were you working at that time?Yeah.Or in school?Yeah, I had started working at age [AGE]And you maintained gainful employment until what age?[AGE].On and off or pretty steady?Depended on the circumstances, yeah.Okay. You had a number of hospitalizations and as I recall there was a very serious attempt at your life in the late 90's.Right.What did you attempt to do?Well my mom was in really bad shape, to answer what did I attempt to do, I think I probably took 60 Ambiens and chased it with, what is it, it's an anti-nausea medicine.Phenergan, Compazine?Compazine.Okay. That was the overdose?Right.Now I understood you made other attempts?Yes, let me think. It's painful to talk about this.I'm sure it is, especially recounting the potentially lethal methods that you used or attempted to use.At that time, it was, you know, I was under, I had a wife that had been through a bone marrow transplant, my mother was, I don't know, I guess she was just progressively dying of cardiac issues, you know...Cardiac failure?Yeah.Okay.And I carried the burden and I just couldn't carry it. I just didn't want to, I couldn't do it and I don't know why I was, what I was really striving for, maybe it was just an illusion.When did things change? When did you swing from the depressed phase into the manic phase, full blown mania? Do you recall?2002And what was that like? What did you experience?I don't remember a whole lot of it.Try your best.[DEIDENTIFIED] was shutting down their site, they said you have two weeks to sell your house, move here or there or whatever. I was still in graduate school. I had to finish that and one day I just, I woke up, and I could differentiate time. I couldn't under-, you know, I didn't know what day it was.Is that the time you were hearing voices too?Yeah.What kind of voices?Just torment. Just...Voices had a gender, were they male, female?Yeah, male.And they were saying....I don't know, a pastor would say it's evil, you know, something attacking me, signs, I don't know, I mean it just...That part's kind of a blur huh?Yeah. But the, I don't know, a lot of things came to the surface that day.My wife was very violent with me and all I could do was hold her hands.Why was she violent to you?Because of all the lifestyle, the things I allowed to happen.I sort of got the impression that you weren't in control of things, that these experiences you were having were....Yeah, I mean that was the perception.Overwhelming to you.Right. I guess...Well let's bring it up to date now. We have you on Lamictal and that's being titrated upwards with our target range being around 200 mg, okay?Uh-huh.And we discontinued Wellbutrin because...Too much mania.It induced mania. Okay. It was quick too wasn't it?Yeah, any of those. Prozac, any of that stuff.So all the SSRI's and...Yeah.And even the SNRI's, Wellbutrin and so forth, those all triggered off the more hypomania though, right?Right, right.Okay but enough to make some significant changes in your functional status here.Right.Where are you now? What phase are you in now?Anxiety, mania.You sound awfully depressed to me.Well I'm trying to control pressured speech, these things, you know, I guess I am.Are you swinging back and forth, are you cycling?If that's what we call it, yeah.Cycling refers to the changes, sudden changes, the polarity of your feelings.Well last night I had a bizarre dream that I was being executed. The one time, you know, I'm not a criminal, never have been, in 2002 when I was arrested, you know, she was attacking me and I was holding her hands...She, your wife?Yeah.Okay. And you were arrested?Right. The police, you know, they put me in an insolation cell, they had weapons drawn pointed at me, playing games, and that didn't help so I guess this is surfacing now, it comes back.Did that experience seem kind of surreal to you?Sure. It's somewhere in the long term thought.All right, sure. What effect does the medications we have you on now, which is predominantly Lamictal and we have you on some Trazodone at night for sleep and I understand that's a catch 22 type of medication.Right. If I go above 100 mg, I feel hung over the next day.Sure.Really.And if you're under 100?You know, it does the best it can do. I mean it's...Does it help with the insomnia?No, not, maybe 40%.Okay.I wish there was a...Well, we're talking about an alternative, you know...Right, right.The Mirtazapine, Remeron and we'll be considering that as a new approach right now and I don't sense that it would have any problem interfering with the Lamictal as we're titrating upwards.Yeah.Okay and thus far, you've had no adverse events, side effects, rash?From Lamictal?Right.No, no, no.And you feel it definitely helps stabilize your mood?Yeah as long as I stay at 150 or above.Okay, you found that empirically to be the...Right.Window range for you?Uh-huh.Okay. All right, that's consistent with what we find as a result clinically.Sure, sure.All right. Well, we're going to, your vitals have been stable [PATIENT NAME], and you've been compliant, you've followed up with your treatment and the laboratory indices look quite stable. We still need to work a little bit on the lipid profile for you because of the elevated cholesterol and the triglycerides are up there as well. Your HDL is low and, but your calculated LDL is 77 so you've got some several factors that are potentially atherogenic.Uh-huh.And I think the increased diet, increased exercise protocol can help improve those numbers. Now you're following up with a PCP or haven't you found one yet?[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] dropped me.Okay.[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I see sometimes.And he dropped you for other reasons.I think he perceives this accidental overdose was intentional, that's my guess, I don't know.With the Klonopin and, or with the Tramadol? What?I don't know.Well that's what we have on the records [PATIENT NAME].I know this seems confusing to you, but we're going to try to reduce that confusion and hopefully these changes here will help stabilize the mood further, okay?Okay.I want to thank you very much...Thank you.For participating in this session, we'll stop for now.All right.", "And we'll set it, how about if we set it here?Okay.Is that going to be in your way?Nope.Okay.So anyway, I got a new addition to my lovely little familyYes.And one more coming. I got a gorgeous little Papillon dog.Really, and you look like you have pictures.Four pounds. Yes I do have pictures.How long have you had it?Uh, let's see, I got him, I spent the entire month up, up in Nebraska with [NAME OTHER]. They bought an, an old Victorian home.Oh really?And it's, uh, it's got a lot of historical, it was the third house in, uh, not [DEIDENTIFIED] to be built by the, the man who did all the plumbing for the town at that time.Oh, okay, yeah.And, uh, it's got some of the historic stuff still in it like the original tile floor in the foyerYeah.And the original fireplace. They took the stairway out, the front stairway out because they made it into an apartment upstairs.Oh yeah.But anyway, it's just a gorgeous little house.Yeah.And big enough for the family. Well, she told me a week and a half, two weeks ago, we're going to have another baby.Oh that's exciting.[LAUGHING] and they're shooting for a girl this time.Yeah.So that's good.Yeah. When are they due?She just found out, so she's right in the early stages or morning sickness and she's gotYeah.[INAUDIBLE].Oh right.But, uh, and he's in Florida, NCO training [LAUGHING].Yeah, yeah.Poor kid, every time she gets pregnant, he's gone.Yeah, that's, I remember that from last time.Yeah.Yeah, so how long were up there?A month.A month?Yeah. I, uh, helped them pack up their house.Yeah.And, uh, they got it sold, and I helped them pack up the house and watched the kids, and then I made, uh, well got, got the kids all settled and went back home, and then I was up again last month for a week and a half, and made curtains for their living room and their foyer and, or little sitting room and, uh, for their kitchen, and going to go back up next month.Oh great.Really excited about that.Yeah, stuff like that, that's nice. It sounds like you two areI get enthused about her house and, and I started making curtains for mine and it's taken me 2 months so far [LAUGHING].Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] there's something more satisfying about doing something for someone else.Especially your daughter.Yeah, yeah.But anyway, she's, you know, she's excited about the baby and yet real upset too because my husband and her mother in law are just way down on it, and they just give her a bunch of crap every time she tells them she's pregnant. You know, that's not fun.Yeah. Yeah.But, and her and her husband both planned it, you know.Yeah.And, uh, she had her husband call my, call dad.Yeah.And, uh, why would she be afraid to tell me about it, and I says because she knew that you just shot a bunch of negative again, and she didn't want to hear it, and quite honestly neither do I, and that's where it's at.How did he respond to that?Well I think it's stupid. They don't need any more kids, and I says like I said, I don't want to listen to it, and neither does she.Yeah.She's happy about it. I'm happy about it. It's one more for me to love.Yeah.And I says if they can handle it financially, why not?Yeah. How are things for you at home?Okay.Yeah.He's never going to change. I'm never going to get him to change. As long as I can get away one, one week out of the month, and not have to listen to his thoughts and, and his not feeling good and that, and have a week away from him, I'm, I can handle it.Good.So.Do, do you guys have any good times together or things that you can enjoy doing as a couple?Not really.Yeah.No, he, uh, if he's with his friends, he can gone for hours, but if we say, I'll say you want to go into [DEIDENTIFIED] with me. Well what are you going to do? And I tell him what I plan on doing. No, I don't want to go. And, uh, if I go in with him because he'll pressure me to go in with him, it's go in, do what he wants to do, always have to eat because all he thinks about is his stomach, and home. And I mean we, it's a 50 minute drive both ways, you know. We could be back home in 2 hours to 2 and a half hours.Um-hum.And it wasn't that fun.Yeah.So I just go wandering off by myself and get lost for sometimes 8 hours.Yeah.Just doing my thing.Do you, can you guys do anything together like a meal out or something like that that maybe is a little bit more potentially enjoyable for both of you, some middle ground?He won't plan, he won't plan anything. I mean I'll say why don't we go do this. Well, we'll see.Yeah.You know, I don't know, we'll see. I'm not, but last 2 weeks, he hasn't been feeling good, so I mean, you know, he just doesn't want to do, I finally took up a new habit, playing computer games because at least I can sit down and start that, and if he yells the dog needs out or something, I can put it on pause and go let the dogs out because he's, he'll let the dog stand there and suffer for 5 minutes or a half an hour before he'll get up and let him out.Yeah.You know.Yeah.It's kind of, it's kind of sad.Yeah.Sometimes I feel so empty when I'm there, you know, just because there's this, you know, like a friend of mine called and, uh, she has emphysema. Well, not emphysema, she's got lung problems, but it's not from smoking, and anyway, she has her oxygen she has to take with and that, and sometimes her kids can't always take her.Um-hum.And she called out of the, you know, clear blue sky not knowing if I would be willing to do it or not and asked if I could take her up to get her blood test for her doctor's appointment, and I said well sure, no problem. Well I wasn't even gone 2 hours and he was all upset because I was, why are you taking her? Why can't her kids take her? And I said because her kids are busy and she needs to get this blood taken before she goes for her doctor's appointment, and I says I don't mind doing it. Well it seems kind of inconvenient, doesn't it? I says nothing's inconvenient for a friend.Yeah.You know, and we ended up going shopping. Well we got home and we were going to sit and have lunch together. I wasn't there 3 minutes and the phone rang. The dog was going crazy and, and I had to get home.Did you, did you go home or did you spend some of your time there?I, I, I sat and visited with her for a little longer, and told her we'd have lunch next time and, and, you know, I went on home.Yeah.I, I didn't want to listen to him when I got home, and she wasn't, she was tired anyway, so.Okay, so [INAUDIBLE].You know, it was just one of those things. It was easier for me to go ahead and leave so she could get her groceries put away anyway, but.Okay.Um, you know, normally I would have stayed, butYeah.You know, the dog was getting a little antsy too because I had the dog.Yeah.You know, the dog was getting antsy and driving him crazy. The dog, if I leave for 3 minutes, I come back and he's got tears running down his face, and he misses me, and he does go hyper.Yeah.He, I was going to ask you can I bring my dog in sometime with me when I visit or do they allow that? He's 4 pounds and he has his own little purse.Bring him in that and bring him on in.Okay.Um, the, uh, yeah, the, the, as a general rule, the issue that they say is, you know, that it's a, somebody should, they, they want to make sure that they're up to date on their shots and all those kind of things.Yeah, yeah. I carry that with me.Yeah, okay. Well, you got that anyway, and besides the fact of, againHe's got his rabies tag on, andYeah.And I, I, uh, because I travel so much between here and, andYeah.Nebraska, I carry the papers with me.Sure, that's fine. And like I said, for a spontaneous visit, uh, you know, and have them with you, it's not going to create an issue.I, uh, I just didn't, well I want you to meet him because he is such a little character. He barksHe sounds like he's brought some real joy to your life.Oh man, I get up and walk 2 to 3 times a day.Wonderful.I wasn't even exercising before.Yeah, good.And he's just, I love him. He's just, uh, my little sweetheart.Are you sleeping at night?Uh, yeah I have been.What do you think you get for hours on average do you get?Anywhere from, anywhere from 6 to 12. It depends. You see him?No.Oops, I bet I hit the button again. I did. All right, hang on a minute.And tell me again how many hours are you getting?Anywhere from, um, 6 to 12. It just depends. I have some days where I'll only sleep maybe 4 hours, and then other times I'll sleep forever.Oh, that's great. Oh, that's great. I like them dogs.Oh, he's a little Papillon and you know, the thing of it is is, you know, as in, uh, oh, there's, um, when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED] with, with [NAME OTHER], uh, he called and told me that these people had this dog that they were going to get rid of, and he was real little, 4 pounds, you know, and it was a Papillon and I says, he says they're going to take him to the pound. I says he's not going to the pound. I want you to go get him.Yeah, yeah.He's, I says I've wanted one for a long time, and I says if, if they can't take care of him and it's too much for them, then you just go get him, and, uh, oh, here we go. I got more of him.As you said, these are grandkid photos. [INAUDIBLE].I go more pictures of the dog than anything.Yeah, yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. Do you, how do you feel like you're doing just kind of mood wise day to day? Are you getting any sustained periods of lows? Are youUh, I get low once in a while, but nothing, you know, not weeks at a time, not, um, not days at a time, just once in a while, just everyday lows, you know. This weather is kind of getting to me.Um-hum.You know, it's, it's gloomy.Yeah.Um, and, and it kind of gets to me, and, um, over the last couple of days I've just felt like of empty because, well I just don't, you know, I get bummed with my husband andYeah.You know, I can't help that, and I can't help the way he is, but, uh, you know, sometimes it's a little[INAUDIBLE].Makes me feel empty because he doesn't want to do anything with me, you know.Ever of that intensity of life isn't worth living, those kind of feelings at all?No. No, I've got all kinds of things to do.That's what you said. I understand from where we've been, yeah, yeah.Yeah, yeah.Uh, do you have, have you had any periods of, of those, those kind of those hypomanias where you go days with markedly diminished sleep and you'reYeah.Yeah.I do have a lot of those. Uh, I, umHow long do they last?Oh they can last for weeks sometimes where I'll go and just, you know, 5:00 on the morning I'm finally going to sleep, you know.When's the last time you went through one of those cycles?I think 2 weeks ago.And how long did that one last?Uh, about 4 or 5 days maybe, you know, just weird.Did you get in any trouble at all through that time?No, no.Spending more?Spent more time sleeping through the day, but, you knowYeah.No problems. I'm still able to function. In fact, I've been functioning better I think this week. I'm actually fixing meals, you know, andYeah.And not resenting fixing the meals. Um, you know, uh, I finally decided well if you don't like the way it tastes, fix it yourself. I'm going to eat it.Yeah.[LAUGHING].Do those episodes, at this point, cause you distress? I mean do they, are they, you know, some people can get to those hypomanias where they're, they're not necessarily a bad thing. They're different. They're a change, and other people really it's, they're still doing things or they're more irritable or they're having a difficult, more difficult time in terms of just kind of their functioning because of it.The only, I get very irritable at home. I, I guess I do snap at, at [NAME OTHER].Does that happen during those times, or is that independent of those times?Those times.Those times.Those times, yeah. I, I do, uh, I do get, you know, and I can tell when, when, when they're hitting me that way.Yeah.You know, and, uh, but the dog has been helping me, me with, control that because if things start getting to me, I, and he's sitting there wagging his tail and whining and getting excited about going someplace, I mean I just pack him up and we go. Last night I walked with him. I walked, uh, well over a mile one way, walked down to [NAME OTHER], uh, to go visit with aYeah.A friend in the rain [LAUGHING]. The poor little dog got cold, but he's the one who led the way [LAUGHING].Yeah.And so I carried him home in my coat, andHow you doing with smoking?I'm not. I'm still smoking like a chimney, you know, maybe worse than a chimney.Last time I talked to you, you were down to about half a pack a day.Well, I'm back to a pack.So it doesn't seem like the Wellbutrin has made a whole lot of difference one way or the other?No I stopped, I stopped taking it.Did you?Yeah.How long ago did you stop it?Oh, about 2 months ago. Maybe I have increased because of it, and I just didn't realize it was really helping. I don't know, but.Well, you know, one of the other things that, that I guess I, I think about [PATIENT NAME] is if, if we would, um, if we would look at a medicine like, um, Lamictal, which isn't anything that you've taken before, but it is a little bit more of a mood stabilizing medicine.That would be wonderful.Yeah, it's, you knowAnd my moods do change.Yeah, well that's what I was going to say, and like I said, and I can appreciate within, within a range, the reason why we haven't been as aggressive with those since you've been off the Depakote is that, you know, that, that they stay in a range that, that hasn't gotten you, you know, truly to a point of, of huge disruptions, but I understandUm-hum.That, uh, your ability and those factors too at home. I mean I, I know that goes beyond just your illness in terms of why it's there, but, uh, I know that you've told me before that he's just not somebody that's likely to go to any couple's therapy and, and put a lot of energy into working on this.Oh no, and he's not. I know he's not.You know, and so I guess that makesHe resents me coming here.And I, and I know you've said that, and I guess my feeling on this is that, that still if we can do anything that, that gives you a greater sense of control at those times, and the thing that I think you, you would like about the Lamictal as opposed to the Depakote when you were on it a few years ago is that it is, the side effect profile is much better. It's a morning medicine. It's once a day. There's a titration up over the course of about 5 weeks to get to the therapeutic dose. Uh, it's not a medicine we don't have to do any blood work on like you did with the Depakote. Um, it is, it's generally what we consider a weight neutral medicine. People don't tend to gain weight on it at all.Wonderful.Typically they don't feel tired or drowsy on it, which is why we've been able to give it to people in the morning. If in any way, shape, or form you, you would, we could always switch it to bedtime because thatUm-hum.That is, it, it works 24 hours a day independent of when you take it.Um-hum.Um, the, the side effect profile, as a general rule for people, involves potential for some dry mouth, mild upset stomach, mild headacheYeah, but I have that with [INAUDIBLE].Well, it's, it's mild and it goes away.Uh-huh.The only very important piece of information we want people to know is that 1 in 10,000 people can get a very serious rash with this medicine. It's called Stevens Johnson syndrome, and it can be life threatening if it's not treated or addressed and people have gone into a hospital with it. The risk factors for that are risk factors that you don't have. People by, this medicine is approved originally for seizures, and so we found that children, uh, had risk for it. People on immunosuppressant medicines, for example, that had, uh, organ transplants or had advancedUm-hum.Stages of, uh, HIV. Um, people aren't taking it in combination with Depakote, uh, or people, if we titrate it up too fast, and that's the key. That's why, it's been out for about 10 years, and so it's in a generic now, which is also very nice, uh, but that it's, it's, what we found is that if, if people don't have those factors, their statistical risks for rash drop. It doesn't mean it's zero. You, you still have risk and what we tell people isIf I notice something strange.If you get a, call me and stop the medicine.Um-hum.You could stop the medicine abruptly. There's no complicated withdrawal symptoms to it. And it's also not a subtlety. It's not something like, you know, you have to be looking for the small of your back to figure out if there could be a rash there.PT:Yeah. People get, they get a rash and, and they notice it, you know. It looks kind of like the Target symbol on people and it's, and any time I've seen anybody get a rash on this medicine, it's not been a serious rash. I mean people can get allergic reactions to the fillerUm-hum.To the dye, um, to all kinds of different things. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a serious version of it, but as a precaution, we have people stop it. The reality is, is some of those same risks are present with things like Depakote, and we didn't ever tell people about it. Uh, the risks were very low. Lamictal, when it first came out, they were very aggressive in the dosage schedule, and so it, it showed itself more than some of the others. So the FDA came in and labeled it specifically for that, but the reality is there's a number of medicines that we use for bipolar almost like Tegretol and Depakote have that warning, and I bet nobody ever told you about it back when you were taking the Depakote.No, Huh-uh.Uh, and that predates [INAUDIBLE].No, I, I get the little pamphlets with it, and I read on it, and I know that there's always a risk just to, you know, most of the time mild, and just watch myself.Well, and like I said, and I don't mean to minimize it, but like I said, we're at 1 in 10,000 or less for you, and so I think that bodes very well in terms of, I've had people do well with it. What I expectYou know what, if it makes me feel better even if it was a high risk for me breaking out with a rash, it's worth a try.Well, and the thing that's nice about this is it's FDA approved in terms of bipolar illness. It's approved as a maintenance medicine, meaning preventing recurrence for depression or trying to prevent recurrence from manias. They actually did studies in Type I bipolar illness, and you have the Type II with the hypomanias even with it. Um, and so in combination, I think it even has a little bit more robust effect.Yeah.I would leave you on the citalopram for the time being.Okay.I think there's a possibility that we could bring dosage down, particularly if we're hitting still a lot of those kind of hypomanic episodes, but let'sYeah.Let's do one thing at a time here because otherwise the citalopram has been good at treating your depression.Because I have, sometimes I have more trouble with the hypo than I do [LAUGHING].Right, and that's, and that's where I think for you, there's where I think it's time to, to come in and get this started.Yeah, because I think that's probably why I have trouble sleeping is I just, um, I can't unwind.Yeah, and, and I think that hopefully what we can do is get your sleep hours to a decent point and, what I've been doing for people is this, the medicine's in a generic, but it's also in a branded product, and only the branded company makes the starter kits, and these starter kits are actually really nice. What they do is they essentially lay out, they've got a picture of it in there. You, you would be on the orange kit. They make a couple. If you're taking divalproex, which is Depakote, there's this one. You're not here, you're here, not taking any of these medicines, and they lay it out. They give you, it's 25 mg once a day for the first 2 weeks, 50 once a day for the next 2 weeks, 100 for the next week.Um-hum.And then I'll write you a prescription for the 200 mg pills. So there's 5 weeks with this kit. They give you $35 off your copayment with that. So I typically write for the branded kit with this coupon, so you get $35 off. So it may not cost you anything at all, and then we can, then we can switch you over and, and there's no problem with going over to the generic, and the Lamictal, the generic is lamotrigine. They sound alike.Okay.But at least it gets youOkay, yeah.Like I said, it's justWell it won't cost me anything because my copay's, uh, for, for, uh, the regular one is $15, so.Oh, right, exactly. So then it won't, and that's [INAUDIBLE].And they won't give me the other $20 I'm sure, but.No, no, right. No, I guarantee they will not do that.But.And I apologize. Let me, there's a code in here that I have to put on it.And then I know I can go to the generic and it's really basically the same thing, so.Yeah. What I expect is that we just see a leveling out.I would like that, you know, because like I said, there are sometimes when I just wonder, uh, I, I, I just feel empty, devoid, you know.Yeah.Uh, and other times I just feel like I can't get enough of people, and I can't get enough of anything, you know, and I just run, run, run. And I guess I've been, I, I guess I don't think too much about it because I've been that way since I was a kid. My mother said I used to go for 24/7 for the longest time, and then all of a sudden I'd stop and I'd sleep 24 hours.Yeah. Well, and I think again, within that range, if we can get you back to the point also of doing the best you can to the part that you can control of getting your sleep hours normalized, you know, closer to that 8 hour time frame, I think you'll also find that that helps with some of those things too.The 6 hour doesn't bother me as much as sleeping 12 or more hours a day, you know.Do your thoughts during those periods where you're, you're sleeping a little less and you're feeling your mood's up, do your thoughts keep going faster? Do you feel like you think faster or talk faster?I probably do and never noticed it.Yeah. Do you, do you ever get any to the point of having odd experiences like seeing things, hearing things?No. No, no.To the point of feeling like your mood's so up that you have powers or abilities other people wouldn't have? Does it ever get to [INAUDIBLE]?No, Huh-uh. No, I've never, no, I've never had any experience like that, but I have gotten to the point where I haven't had enough sleep where sometimes I'll move and I'll get dizzy and I feel like I'm going to, you know, and I have to stop myself, but, uh.So I've got 2 prescriptions here for you. The first one is the starter and that's got your citalopram on it.Okay.But it's got the Lamictal and it's just got what they call the orange starter kit, and then you'll take that exactly as, as that's prescribed, and then the next one here is yourOkay.Prescription once you get through that starter kit.Okay.Is the one you're taking.All right.You know, in a very different way, it may also be that if we get you some more leveling in this effect, that that's also an easier combination to quit smoking with too.It could very well be because I really, I really know that I need to quit smoking. Right now, I can still get out and walk. I can still do things, you know, and, uh, I, I feel good, you know, as far as physically, other than a little bit of pain in the left, the right lung, but, you know, I can still do things.Yeah, yeah, but you're right. You'll feel better and you'll save some bucks.Okay, I will.I want to see you back in 6 weeks with these changes though.Okay, that sounds good.And like I said, if there's any, if there's any problems, if there's any concerns or anything with it, call me.Well the only problem I might have would be that I'm going up next month to be with [NAME OTHER] for a while before Christmas so that she can do some things.Well, andAnd if, uh, if there's a problem with that, I'll just call, reset the appointment if I know if I'm going to be into trouble.Yeah.And request a, a refill.That's right, exactly. We've got, and like I said, and you've really got over, you've got over 2 months of everything.Yeah. Yeah, so I should be all right.Yeah.And, uhIf, if at any point you end up off the Lamictal for 5 days or longer, we need to titrate back up the same way you started it.Okay.So don't miss, don't miss 4 or 5 days because that'sNo.Pushing the limits of getting back onto that dose.Yeah.If, if you miss a day or 2 here or there, that's okay.Okay.ButYeah, I likeBut [INAUDIBLE].I don't like to miss.No, no, and I don't like people to miss either. We'll agree on that, but like I said, it's more important [INAUDIBLE] we don't have to stick with me. Just call me.I will. I will.[INAUDIBLE].You have a happy Thanksgiving.Thank you. To you too. It's good to see you.You take care of that family.Thank you. I will.If you're going away for the holidaysYou enjoy those gifts.Drive safe.Yep, I appreciate that.I think [NAME OTHER] actually going to come down unless she's got trouble with morning sickness.Oh, that's nice. Good. Good. Um, like I said, you take care of yourself, and if there's anything, you call me, but otherwise I'll see you back in 6 weeks.All right.Okay.Thanks.You're welcome, bye bye.", 'This is interview number five.I\'m sorry I didn\'t come last week but I wasn\'t feeling well.That\'s fine.And I really hated to miss it because I had some weird things happen that week. I had a really strange dream that really kind of shook me up. I dreamt that I had gone somewhere to a clinic or something. It was a place where they killed you for a fee. It was like a suicide center. And it was real...it seemed like a really long dream and it was so real. I was really upset about it because I had been so preoccupied with this suicide business that...it was really funny because in the dream I fought to get out of the place after I had signed to go in. [1:19]So it was almost like you were doomed to this end. You clawed your way out.Mm-hmm. And it was like, "I really don\'t want to die." I just kept thinking of suicide as the means to ending all my problems. And then last week, we were at a Christmas Day gathering with my family. Right in the middle of the evening, I just savagely attacked my father. And it was really kind of upsetting because everyone in the whole room just sort of sat there. [2:03] Charlie was really upset because he couldn\'t believe it. It was like...I was in another part of the house and he just came tearing into the room. It really upset me afterwards.It was so freaky because you just exploded out of nowhere?Mm-hmm. It was just...see, I had been in another part of the room and they had been having this big political discussion. I have really made an effort to stay out of these because my father and I disagree so much about it. But I think it\'s like my one way of getting back at him...not on a personal level. And all of a sudden...I don\'t even remember how it happened or anything...but I was just like barging down the hallway.The next minute I knew, I was just standing over him. I was poking my finger right in his face, and I was screaming so loud that it was echoing through the room. It only lasted maybe about two to three minutes, but it seemed like it lasted a lot longer. Then after I had recovered from it and everything, I realized what I had done. [3:13]Just out of nowhere. Like you\'re kind of out of control.Mm-hmm. It was definitely hysterical because I couldn\'t even re-track my steps to think of what prompted it or why I chose that particular moment or...So now you\'re thinking, "Why on earth did I do that? Maybe it might happen again."Mm-hmm. Well, things have happened like that before, but never quite that way where it was such a sudden burst. I mean, usually I would be right in the room or right involved in the conversation, and maybe tempers would flare or something. But this was like I wasn\'t even there and the next minute, I was there just hovering over him. It was very...well the thing that was so terrible about it was that I felt like I owed him an apology. I did apologize, but I did it kind of jokingly, because I was really afraid to let myself break down. And when we left I...when I got home, I called and I...Charlie had said, "Well, I think you should call him and explain to him, or try to explain to him why you did it." And I ended up explaining it to my mother. I wouldn\'t talk to him because I was afraid that I would start to cry or really...my emotions would really break down.You see, the thing that upset me so badly was that when I had tried to apologize to him, he passed it off like it was nothing. I think if he would have responded to me differently, I would have been able to maybe have shown to him what I had done and why. But by him doing that to me, it didn\'t seem important anymore. [5:16]Yeah, it sounds like you weren\'t important.Mm-hmm. And yet when...well like for the next two days, I was just obsessed with him dying. That always happens whenever I have these outbursts with him. I just get so emotionally drained by it because I keep thinking that I\'m going to be punished for treating him that way.Mm-hmm. For being angry.Mm-hmm. And I really wish that I could talk to him about it, but I can\'t. I can\'t relate to him on either his terms or my terms.How do you feel about that right now? I mean, can you get into that? How do you feel him, not being able to talk to him, about getting angry and all that?I feel resentful in a lot of ways, because the thing when...when he and my mother used to argue, he used to always come to me. It really didn\'t make any difference how personal it was. He would come to me. And of course it would be his side of the story. It seemed like most of the time, I would take his defense. I would get into vicious arguments with my mother over defending him.He would come to you and you didn\'t like that. Do you know why? [6:39]No, I didn\'t like it because it...well, it used to bother me when they argued anyway, even when I grew older. And then, when he would come to me, it would personally involve me in it. I couldn\'t close the door and leave the house. I would be actually involved in it then.(inaudible at 6:57) part of the game.Mm-hmm. And I don\'t...I resented it because I felt like he was more or less trying to turn me against my mother."What\'s he pulling me into this for? On top of that, he\'s trying to make me against her."Mm-hmm. And then whenever we would get into a discussion...like my mother and I...about something about staying out too late or something, sometimes he would jump in, in the middle of it, and really wouldn\'t even know the basis of it to begin with. But then he would start hammering away at me. It would be that...it was always a science in our house. It was either my mother and I were against him, which didn\'t happen very often, or he and I were against my mother, which happened frequently, or my mother and him were against me, which happened just as frequently. There was never that...where we were all able to sit down and discuss it together kind of a situation.One time, he just came bursting into one of these arguments and started really jabbing below the belt with really ridiculous remarks about my morals and everything. And he reached out for me and I ran for the basement stairs. And he grabbed the back of my dress and he ripped the whole back...like just right down the back. And I was like in a state of shock. I was like 18 years old and I couldn\'t believe it.When he walked out of the room, I thought my mother would say, "Well, he shouldn\'t have lost his temper that way," but instead, she turned around and said that I had owed him an apology because I drove him to losing his temper. And I wouldn\'t apologize. So we hadn\'t talked for two or three days because I just couldn\'t face him. It was like he had really...like ripped into me personally by doing that. [9:22]And then you\'re going to get so far away from them that they can\'t to you, or something like that.Mm-hmm. And I didn\'t even...we never talked about it after that. It was just like dropped. And that was the way everything was in our house. If a matter was brought up for argument and someone wouldn\'t give in and apologize, then it was just forgotten about. But it really never was forgotten about.So all that tension and conflict hanging in the air.Mm-hmm. And we...I think that\'s why I have the feelings that I do now. Because, I mean like I really try to go out of my way to be nice to him and respectful and to really let him know that I really do love him. But I just can\'t come out and say it.And like when we got married...Would you kind of like to make up for it?No, but it\'s just that I feel guilty because I feel like I was their only child and I never really had the relationship with them that I think...that I would have wanted to have with my parents, or vice versa for them. There\'s always been like a line between us. And I can remember it as far back as I can remember.That\'s true. You\'ve been really cut off and isolated from them.Well see, they never...they never really let me develop into what I wanted to be. Ever. I mean it was always...I think with my mother, it was fear of an only child. She thought that she would lose her hold on me or that something would happen to me. And with my father, I think it was always kind of the fact that...I think he resented not ever having any other children and that he had to build all of his dreams just around me and no one else. [11:40]And so it was always what they thought that I should be or what I should...what they thought I should do. And just...it just kept going from the time that I started school until even now. They still have their digs about things that they think that I\'m doing wrong or that I should be doing differently.It just kept going. You weren\'t good enough.Mm-hmm. Yeah, they always...yeah, it was funny. Like they always felt that I wasn\'t excelling like I should or doing in school like I could do. And yet they never really pushed me into...Always not quite good enough, but they didn\'t care enough to push you.Mm-hmm. Because whenever the subject of college would come up or anything, it was always just kind of shoved off to one side. Because I don\'t think they really wanted me to go away. That was the whole...the whole thing behind that.And so, like they weren\'t happy with the fact that I wasn\'t getting the best grades that they knew I was capable of getting. But it was...it didn\'t mean enough to them to really push the issue or to sit down and find out why. And I think that...That\'s where you were left, right?Mm-hmm.They didn\'t care enough to find out why. They didn\'t care enough to discuss things with you. [13:22]Yeah. The only time...like when I was in the second half of my junior year, I started going with a fellow who was very active in school and was National Honor Society and everything. And from that period, until I graduated, I did excellent in school. And it was because he was pushing me all the time, because grades were really important to him. He would help me at home and...it was so funny because my parents couldn\'t figure out the change, and I guess I didn\'t either at the time.But you needed somebody to push you.Mm-hmm. Up until that time, anybody I\'d ever dated was really like nothing. And so there was never an influence there that I guess I really needed. But I think even with my relationship with Charlie, they resented that, too, right from the start. Because I don\'t think they felt that Charlie was good enough for me. I don\'t know why. Whether it was because of his family background or because of the way he was when he came over.I mean, he has his certain beliefs and ideals in life, which he speaks out very strongly on. And he\'s not a "yes man" to my father. The first couple of years we were married, my father kept provoking arguments with him and digging him with these really ridiculous things. He would jokingly say something like...that he was going to make a heathen out of his daughter, or that he had changed my whole political philosophy. And just everything that was really personal to my father, he was bringing out in me in saying that Charlie had caused these changes.And then he would start digging at him and they would get into these violent arguments to the point where Charlie wouldn\'t argue with him anymore. Then he became very resentful of him because he wouldn\'t argue with him. [15:53]So it\'s just been a continuous chain of events since I can remember with him. That\'s probably why I do lash out at him like that without even thinking about it. I don\'t know. But it really bothers me because I know that it hurts him. And I don\'t want to do it because I don\'t see any point in it now. It\'s not going to really change what has happened over the years between he and I, and yet I keep doing it. And it upsets me a great deal.But the one good thing that has happened...really, out of all of this I think...is that it has pulled...my feelings with Charlie are closer. We seem to be adjusting to each other better now than we ever have before. And we\'ve...well, we had a talk about some of these problems...these sexual problems that we have. And I\'ve told him some of the things that I wish that he would change. And it has made a little bit of a difference. It\'s kind of developing slowly, but it\'s changing a little.I\'m having trouble getting a sense of what\'s real for you right now about that. I sort of feel like you\'re telling me about it or something. Where are you with it?With the sexual...?Or with Charlie. I mean, I\'m having trouble getting a hold of that. If it were me, it would be, "If sex wasn\'t so lousy right now," or "I want it to go here or there and I can\'t do that." Where are you? [17:56]Right now, I think...I think it\'s at a standstill. I think that...that we are both like...I don\'t feel as secure in my marriage as I did six months ago, because of things that he has said to me, and I\'m sure because of things that I have said to him. I think that we\'re kind of both just waiting to see what\'s going to happen next. At times, I feel like it\'s starting to rebuild into a solid union. And then something will happen, and it will kind of take the edge off of that a little. But then it will go back. It\'s sort of like...right now, it\'s just something that we keep tossing back and forth at each other. I don\'t know. Some of the things that are happening...I don\'t know if it\'s good or bad. I\'m trying to hold back on reproaching him for different things. And yet, I don\'t know if that\'s totally right. Because I feel like this is going to go back to the way it was when we first got married...when I never said anything.So holding back...you\'re not sure about that?Mm-hmm. With him, I feel that for some reason or another...I think he has the feeling that he\'s let me down, and that he\'s trying to rebuild a wall of security around me because he feels that he has to be protective of me.Mm-hmm. Right now?No. I mean, this is, I think, what his idea of marriage is and his relationship to me anyway...maybe not if he were married to someone else. But we\'ve talked about it to some degree...about how his feelings to me are similar to the feelings toward his mother, in that she never really provided him a warm type of protective security and that this is what he was looking for in marriage. [20:26]Someone to protect him?Mm-hmm. To protect him and mother him. But unfortunately, I was looking for the same thing. And so it was like a game with us. We were always playing this little baby-talk type of little game.And it\'s like before...you don\'t want to let it out or something like that?It\'s funny. I really enjoy it. I think that\'s what bothers me. That\'s what I mean when I said this little...we had these little things that we\'d say to each other and all that. I think that\'s one reason why the thought of children breaking into this little thing we have with each other is...How could somebody else be a child when you both are children already?Yeah, because we make such big deals out of little things. It\'s funny, but we sort of don\'t break it out in front of other people. But we have slipped in front of his brother or someone like that. They\'ve commented on the way that we say different words or different expressions we have that we use toward each other. And they\'re sort of laughing at us because I guess it does sound silly like baby talk.I guess that\'s when I really became aware of the fact that that was what we were doing. Up until that time, no one had ever brought it to my attention. So I think that\'s where we...we talk about children and that, but I really don\'t think that either of us want them now. I mean we may change, but right now...because we can\'t even communicate with each other on an adult level.I can\'t...I mean we can...it\'s funny, like we can communicate with each other on an adult level about things that don\'t affect us personally, but not about each other\'s problems. We sort of laugh them off or make a joke or something like that. [23:03]With the sexual aspect of our marriage, I kind of have relaxed a little bit with that. I mean, it still bothers me because I still don\'t have any kind of burning desire. But I don\'t find it as much of a torture to have a relation with him now, that I did maybe two months ago. And I think a lot of it is the procedure that he\'s following. It\'s not some kind of cold, cut-and-dry machine that just operates on one cycle a week and that\'s it. It has changed my feelings toward him. I can respond to him better now, too because of this, and also because of...I love him. I do want to make him happy and I don\'t want him to go to someone else to satisfy his needs.So you want to do that for him.Mm-hmm. And when I make him happy, then I feel good. It\'s like anything. It\'s not just sex. It\'s anything that I might do around the house or do that would please him. But I told him that I didn\'t want to go to school. And he...I don\'t think he was very happy with it and I think he\'s hoping that I\'ll still change my mind. [25:05]That was hard to tell him.It was because I had been avoiding the issue, but I think he was sort of prepared for it because of that...because I hadn\'t made an effort to go down and enroll or go through any of the preliminaries of it. And the only thing is that I didn\'t really tell him why I didn\'t want to go. I just used an excuse of money for not going.Was it embarrassing or something?Yeah, I think so because it\'s like...to me, the important thing to Charlie is an active person...an active mind. I think he\'s afraid that if I\'m just going to be sitting home five or six days a week, that I\'m going to get very stagnant and boring to him. I don\'t think he\'d be quite as concerned about it if I read or did some of the things he thinks are important in life. Then I don\'t think he\'d be that concerned about it. But I think he feels that I need that activity. Because basically, I am the type of person who can just get really lazy if I\'m put into kind of a routine situation. [26:48]He doesn\'t like that and it\'s kind of embarrassing to tell him that?No, he\'s aware of it. I mean, I don\'t really have to tell him because he can tell by the way that I\'m getting. Like when I start really talking about trivia or if I start getting really (inaudible at 27:12) and not doing things on schedule. He can see that it\'s happening. And it has been happening in about the last four or five weeks. I\'ve started to come out of it now and I can see his attitude change toward me. Even if what I\'m doing doesn\'t really maybe make me any kind of a more-rounded person, if I get up and wash the kitchen walls, that gives him something like, "Well, she\'s doing something. She\'s not just laying around."He wants you to be active.Mm-hmm. And I think I figured out why. Because I think he resents the fact that he has to go out to work and I\'m not doing anything constructive with my time.Is that...have you checked that out with him or is that (inaudible at 28:17)?That thought just hit me. Because it\'s...we always have a joke about that. On the mornings that he has to get up that I don\'t get up, or vice versa, there has always been a little jealousy between us. I resent having to get up to go to work on a day that he has off or something. And I think the same holds true with him. Maybe when he comes home after working all day and doesn\'t see anything accomplished or anything done, then he gets resentful of it. [29:00]Yeah. Not only did he have to go to work while you sat home, when you sat home, you didn\'t do anything.But the funny thing is that I think if he were to come home after a day, and I would say, "Well, I just read 400 pages of War and Peace," I don\'t think that would really impress him. I mean, to me that would really be doing something. But that\'s not physical. That\'s why like at school...when I did go to school for a while when we were married, he still expected me to maintain the kind of house and meals along with school at the same time. It was hard. I would go to class and before I\'d go to class at night, I\'d have to have dinner on the table so that he could eat while I was in class. And I don\'t think that\'s fair. And I think that that\'s why going to school doesn\'t mean that much to me because it\'s going to be like double work. I keep thinking of that all the time.And he keeps making you do two things.Yeah, because this goes back to...like with his mother. His mother worked for as long as he can remember. But she worked. That was it. She didn\'t maintain a home. She didn\'t prepare meals that often. She never washed or ironed for the kids. It was like they were adults from age seven on up. I can see now why this would upset him if he were married to a woman who would be the same way. But it can\'t all be waiting on you. [30:52]I make jokes now about, "Well, I don\'t find tips under your plate at the end of a meal," and stuff like that.So it is like you really resent serving him or something like that. You\'re not getting anything out of it. You\'re just like a maid sometimes.Mm-hmm. A maid or a mother. Because the mother usually doesn\'t complain if she has to get up 50 times during the meal to get this or that.The part of it that really...I mean, it\'s not the mothering him that bothers you. It\'s something like you\'re not getting anything out of it or having him force you to do it or demanding you do it, or something like that.Yeah, I think that\'s it. I mean, it\'s like I don\'t...I know that there are times when perhaps I deserve to be scolded because I\'ve done something wrong or I haven\'t done something. But I resent having him come home at the end of the day and saying, "Well, what did you do today?" or "I hate to ask you this, but what did you do all day?"It\'s like already a put-down.Yeah, and before...and then I stand there like trying to justify every hour of the day.Like he really puts you on the line there. You\'ve got to justify yourself for him.Mm-hmm. And I don\'t...I really do resent that because I don\'t feel that I have to run that house for two people like some kind of organized ship. It\'s ridiculous! But I started off on the wrong foot. That\'s what I did from the beginning. I went through the routine of getting up every morning and fixing breakfast and all that kind of stuff. And of course, this was like a new thing to him. Then when it started to slow down and then it went into the point where it really slowed down to just the normal everyday things, not really going out of your way all the time, I think it was hard for him to accept. And I get these really strong guilt feelings about it, like I\'m really letting him down. And so then I\'ll get this really big conscientious drive to get back into the routine of things. Yet, I don\'t feel that...I don\'t feel comfortable in that situation because that\'s not why...I didn\'t get married for that.It sounds like you always have to measure up or something. That\'s not what marriage is about. [33:45]See, I was...it was so similar to that at home, that that\'s probably why I resent it, too. Because when I lived at home, I had two days off a week. And the free day that I had, which I really considered a free day, was during the week, not a Sunday or something like that. But I always had this little list of chores that I had to do that day, instead of doing what I wanted to do on that day off.Always somebody imposing something on you that you didn\'t want to do.Mm-hmm. And I preferred to go along at my own pace. I like to do what I want to do when I want to do it. When I start a job, I\'ll usually finish it. Sometimes it takes me awhile, but I\'ll finish it. But I don\'t like someone standing there with a timetable telling me when I have to have it finished.Like, you\'ve got to be your own person in that. Why should people lay their stuff on you?I think that from what he has told me in the last couple of weeks that he is aware that he has done this to me. He keeps talking about how he should be the protector and the one who should offer the security, and that I should be able to lean on him, but it\'s sort of been like in the reverse. I haven\'t seen any kind of a measurable change. I mean, I know he\'s aware of it, but it\'s not really happening.Who should be the protector? [35:56]That he should. And that I...that I should be able to come to him with my problems, and that I should be able to feel relaxed and comfortable in our situation...in a marriage situation. And sometimes I do. I really find that it\'s not a chore at all being married. For the most part, I don\'t. Except that I guess it comes out in other ways when I get these really high-strung periods where I can\'t concentrate on any given thing for a certain period of time, or I have these hysterical attacks like I did on Christmas and this sort of thing. I mean because I...that has happened to me before. It hasn\'t just happened with my father. It bothers me that I can lose control of myself that way. Or that I could just...that I can\'t see myself as a relaxed...kind of a level-minded type of person. I get emotional at the wrong times about the wrong things. And it shouldn\'t be that way.As you\'re watching yourself, you feel like you should be different. Being different would be not so high-strung and not out-of-control... like that?Mm-hmm. Like, we\'ll talk about things that I feel that I would like to do with my time. And I don\'t know...I can\'t really blame Charlie that I don\'t do them, although he doesn\'t really give me that encouragement like, "I think that\'s a great idea." [38:38]I get a big kick out of volunteer work. And it\'s always like, "Well, if you\'re going to be tied up all day with that, you know you could get a job," or that sort of thing. Well, that\'s not the same thing to me. Because the kind of work that I would like to do, I could never get paid for because I\'m not properly qualified. But yet, I could do it on a volunteer basis and get enjoyment out of it and satisfaction.And then he tells you that\'s not any good.Well, we talked about it. It\'s not that...I don\'t think he feels that it\'s any...maybe he feels that I would get too wrapped up in it.And never do anything else?Maybe. Or that I would become too emotionally involved with it.(inaudible at 39:34)Well, like when I...when we talk about what I would want to be if I did go to school, I\'ll tell him, "Well, I think maybe I would like to be a social worker or something," and he\'ll say, "Well, I don\'t think that you really could because you would get too emotionally involved." And I probably would from past experiences. So maybe he\'s afraid that if that did happen, that that would just set me more off balance than I feel about myself already. Then I would never really get anything done.Too emotionally involved...you\'d get too upset from the work?No, that I start to identify too personally with other people and their problems because then it\'s like an escape from my own problems.I see.And I think basically that\'s true. Because if I read an article about someone or I hear about someone, that\'ll upset me emotionally. Then I can\'t think of anything else for two or three days. When I think about it, I cry and I get really upset. But I\'m not thinking about myself or anything that affects me personally when this is going on.Yeah, I see. It\'s like you just keep practicing at everything, but just can\'t your (inaudible at 41:15) back.And this was one thing that...the work that I did do never caused me to get this way. It did for a while, until I realized that it was really stupid. But I was a hairdresser and people would talk to me about their problems. And I would really get really hung up about it. I\'d come home and that was all I\'d talk about. For two hours I\'d just ramble on about something that they would tell me. And he would really get upset about it. "That\'s really stupid. What are you getting...?" and so I don\'t do that anymore. I\'ve really kind of turned off to that whole thing. [42:06]But I think if I were working with people directly, that I would...it wouldn\'t be that easy to turn off. I mean, you couldn\'t because that\'s not why you\'re there. I probably would take it home with me and do the same thing only it probably would be much worse. And I think that goes back to the fact that it has to be just him and me and our problems. Forget everybody else.Yeah. Face up to them.Mm-hmm. And I don\'t...I personally have a very strong feeling about that...that Charlie is convinced that our marriage is going to come to an abrupt end. I\'ve had this really uneasy feeling about him for about the last month or so. Because he keeps talking in such negative tones about it..."Well, if this marriage works out," and that sort of thing. It\'s a new kind of talk. He\'s never talked to me that way before. I don\'t feel that way. His feelings aren\'t making me change. But it\'s just sort of an uneasy feeling. I get this weird feeling that when he leaves for work in the morning, he\'s not going to come home at night. Sometimes I prepare myself all day for it. "What will I do?" "Who will I call?" "Where will I go?" I just go through the whole thing. I just map it all out in my mind. Then he comes home and I just forget about it. And then two days later, the whole thing will happen again.You\'re really afraid of losing him.Mm-hmm. And I don\'t really know where he\'d go. I mean, it\'s just like I get this really weird feeling that he\'s just not going to come home. Or like sometimes if he goes out at night, I have the feeling that he\'s just not going to come back. I haven\'t been able to talk to him about this. I don\'t know why. I just don\'t want to talk about unpleasant things, I guess. [44:53]It\'s hard. Then you might find out he would leave.I think so because whenever I\'ve asked him a direct question, he\'s usually been pretty truthful and blunt about it. It\'s sort of unsettling. You don\'t know how to respond to it after he blurts out this thing that you know was maybe true all along. So I just don\'t ask. I\'m aware of it. I mean, I have a feeling that it could happen and I guess I\'m sort of like bracing myself for it.Yeah. It\'s like you\'re just waiting for a thunderstorm. You don\'t have any control over it.I don\'t think that it\'s even in his mind, but sometimes I have a feeling that...he gets so strung-out about things that these pressures build. He just...I just like to have hysterical fits...he has other things that I can see in him. But when these things start to come out of him, it\'s like frightening to me because I know that something is bothering him and I can see it. That\'s why I guess I have the feeling that there would never be a warning if he did, because he would just like really blow up and just go.So now you see these little troubles he\'s having and that might be what\'s coming before (inaudible at 47:09).Mm-hmm.Then he\'d just go and you would be left.But I\'m not afraid of it as I used to be. A couple of times, like when he was in school, he wouldn\'t come home until 10 o\'clock that night. He wouldn\'t call or anything. I would get really upset and angry about it. Then I would really get frightened that either something had happened to him or that he wasn\'t coming back. But I really don\'t get that frightened anymore because I feel that if the marriage does fall through, then I\'m just going to have to accept it. It would be very difficult for me because I\'m not that agreeable to that kind of a change, but it would be something that I would just have to work out. [48:26]It\'s not the end of the world. You can manage. On the other hand, there\'s something that you\'re saying...it\'s almost like you are just waiting for it to happen. I mean it\'s like assuming that you have no control over what\'s happening now...like you\'re just letting it go until kaboom!That\'s sort of the feeling I have and I don\'t know why. We get into these deep discussions...well, especially now...and we talk about a lot of things. But I keep having the feeling that the point is being missed. It\'s like we\'re just going around it and I can\'t put my finger on it. Maybe if I could, then I would be able to sit back and relax and not get...What is the point? (inaudible at 49:24)I don\'t know. I can\'t...I can\'t put my finger on it. I don\'t know if it\'s because I could be questioning my own feelings and my own love that it frightens me to even think about it, so I don\'t. We just touched on it that one time when he told me about why he married me. And I think if that conversation would have gone along any farther, then there might have been more to come out of it.Can you feel yourself in that right now and try and get back in it and when it was there was the point there? [50:09]Well, it was like both of us...we were each telling ourselves that we were each good for each other and that we were both pushing. I was pushing hard for a long time and I think that\'s still a part of it...was because I had been sleeping with him. But I feel like maybe at that point in my life, I felt that I had reached nothing. I was going nowhere and I wasn\'t doing anything. And there was like a change that was needed desperately at the time.My best friend was moving to Texas. I mean, I could have gone with her, but I really didn\'t want to. I was afraid to make that kind of a change. So there really wasn\'t that much left for me to do except maybe to just move out of the house or get married. It had...it was right there. [51:30] The thing that always bothered me...and it still does...is that I was very close with someone else at the time. And the closeness was still there, even after I became pretty attached with Charlie. For a long, long time, that haunted me a lot, a lot. Like I had really kind of maybe made the wrong decision. I had an opportunity to see this fellow about two or three years after we were married. I had pretty well convinced myself that I hadn\'t made the wrong decision. I mean, really. I think I was right. But yet, that meeting with him was very traumatic for me. I cried for the whole next day over it. I don\'t know if it was because of just a feeling of loneliness for him or what. But I think that all of that is why I\'m where I\'m at today with Charlie.Because it was really mixed up when you first got married?Mm-hmm. Oh and before, too...the whole year before. It was just like a merry-go-round.You could have chosen somebody else and you weren\'t quite sure if Charlie was right and you were thinking...The really tragic thing is that Charlie wasn\'t really included in much of this, where the other fellow was perfectly aware of my relationship with Charlie. I had many long, serious discussions with him about it and I think he realized that I was very mixed up. He was trying to guide me in the right direction, but I didn\'t take it that way at the time. I thought he was doing it for his own personal interest. I don\'t think he really was. I don\'t really think that I ever would have even married him because we had developed into too good of a friendship. We were too outspoken with each other. [54:01]Yet, I could never discuss anything, not even a little pinpoint of this, with Charlie because he would immediately turn it off. He didn\'t want to hear about anything that had to do with me and someone else. So I would keep striving to just keep him out of this picture completely, but he wasn\'t really out of it. My mother kept pushing me and saying, "You can\'t keep doing this. You have to make a decision." Well, why did I have to make a decision? It was stupid. I don\'t think she pushed me into marriage, but she kept saying, "Well, you just..." I think she realized that both of them cared for me deeply and that I was playing a game with them, but I wasn\'t. I really didn\'t know how to cope with this. [55:00] I was very infatuated with Charlie because he was probably the most interesting and different type of person that I had ever dated. He was, in many ways, very responsive. But I couldn\'t...but I honestly wondered why... if that\'s one now. Now that I\'m five years older...four years older...that I\'ve changed and I\'ve become a different person...if I\'ve kind of grown away from that infatuation. That\'s what scares me.It\'s like it was all wrong from the beginning. Now maybe you\'re just finding that out.Mm-hmm. Because I have these weird feelings about future. I can\'t think of future. And I can\'t think of...I don\'t know...it\'s really funny. Yet I\'ve been able to...like when we lived in California, I could never see living anywhere else. It was like that was the life there at the time. I couldn\'t visualize changing that and it did and it was alright.Now I find that I\'m in the same situation again. I can\'t think of moving or houses or children or anything that involves a change because I don\'t know if that change will ever take place. I can\'t look that far. I would think that you would. I mean, you would think of these things in a practical perspective of change, and I can\'t. I don\'t know if it\'s because I don\'t know if I will be able to survive that length of time. [57:20]I can\'t really honestly say that I don\'t love him, because I do. I have a strong feeling for him. I\'m sure that it\'s love, but I don\'t know what kind of love it is.There are a lot of doubts in it.I mean, I don\'t know if it\'s like a marital love or a security type of love. We have been good for each other and I\'m sure that we have satisfied each other\'s needs. We\'ve had the good times and the bad times and all that. But I don\'t know if it\'s a long-lasting kind of a love or if it\'s something that\'s just going to drift into nothingness.Yeah. You really don\'t know where it\'s going. If you\'re not sure what it is, then it\'s even harder to hang on to.The thing that I guess really depresses me is that it has nothing to do with him at all. It\'s me. I\'m the one who has the really upsetting mental picture of all of this. And I can\'t even begin to talk to him about it because I am sure that it would really shock him. I don\'t think he even imagines it. I can\'t see how I could even approach the subject with him. [59:28]Like how to start, you mean?Mm-hmm.Because it\'s so big and so much of it is kind of crazy or something.Mm-hmm. I think the one thing that really bothers me the most is maybe this is why I have started this constant picking and gnawing at him about different things that in the past, never bothered me.Because you have all this stuff to say, but you don\'t know where to start. So it has to just sort of jump out in little ways.Mm-hmm. I\'ve always thought of people who aren\'t happily married as people who are naggers or really kind of not close at all. I feel like that\'s what I\'m becoming...a real nag. Because I\'m just really...I\'m barking at him constantly. He barks at me, but he\'s always done it. With him, it\'s not nagging. It\'s just his way. I think that to him, it\'s my way of getting back at him. That\'s sort of the way he\'s figured it out from what he\'s told me. But I don\'t think that\'s it at all. Because I don\'t want to get back at him. I\'m not playing that kind of a game. But I think it\'s because in many ways, I am unsure of my feelings right now. It\'s making me very nervous. [61:03]By picking him apart, it\'s like strengthening my doubts. Like, "Maybe you were right. Maybe you shouldn\'t have done what you did," and that sort of thing.I didn\'t quite get that. You\'re picking at him, then you think you did the wrong thing by marrying him? You can confirm that. The fact that you\'re having to nag at him is like a confirmation that it wasn\'t right in the first place.Mm-hmm. And it just...it doesn\'t...the nagging...it\'s like...well, I\'ve kind of been watching it since we got on that big talk about his drinking. But I\'m not going to say that it doesn\'t bother me because it really does. I didn\'t say anything to him about it, but it does. It really bugs me and I can\'t stand it.The drinking?Mm-hmm. And I don\'t say anything. But I can\'t...I know that I can\'t just hold off indefinitely about it to say anything.So it\'s really tough to hold down the nagging.It\'s not at the drinking. It\'s the way he acts after he\'s been drinking that bothers me. And if I...maybe he acted like this before. This is what I\'m trying to find out now. Did he just start acting like this? Am I blaming his...the way he acts now on our problems and this is like his release or did he act like this before? And that\'s what I really can\'t put my finger on. So I don\'t know. I\'m at a loss with this whole thing.', "How are you?Good.[INAUDIBLE], you're better?Yeah.Are you, good.Yeah. For the most part.What's going on?Uh, I got, I got a pretty good attitude about work, um, 2 things the, this is what I remember about Effexor, too, by the way, it, uh, you know, I'm a sweaty Bavarian to begin with and I seem to be sweating more than usual and I think the Effexor did that, too.Yeah, yeah.So is that a side effect, sweating?Prozac, oh, definitely, yeah.Okay. And I'm still a little, you know, I can't get off the caffeine, [LAUGHING], which is probably a problem, too. But, when I take the Prozac, I get kind of wound up a little bit.Really?Yeah.Uh, are you at 40 now?Yeah.Yeah. Was it greater at the 40 than the 20, this wound up feeling?No. It's the same.What, what is the caffeine do?Well, I'm just, I'm just guessing that it's the caffeine -Um-hum.With the Prozac. I don't know, I, it, it, I'm still a little like this in the morning.Mm. Wonder if it's, uh, how much caffeine are you drinking?Too much.Could you cut back on the caffeine?I, I can, but I, you know. I have to try harder doing that, I think.Really.Yeah.That makes me wonder about stimulants, you never had a, like as a kid, anybody suggest ADD problems or attention deficit problems or anything like that?No, I was decent in school and stuff, so -And focused and organized and -Yeah.Does caffeine have a calming effect or a stimulating effect for you?At first calming, I guess.Oh, you know -I get up and have a Diet Mountain, 2 Diet Mountain Dews right off the bat.And it calms you down.It, uh, yeah, a little bit.Um. Makes me wonder. Um, the caffeine -I tried, I tried taking Prozac at night, but in the morning, it's still that way.Hum.I'm still a little jumpy.I, you're not anxious at all? No?No.You're calm and you're not depressed anymore and -No.Well, I mean, we could, what are you taking, just the Prozac now?What do you mean?No other medicine for physical reasons?No.Nothing. So all you take is the Prozac?Uh-huh.Nothing else.Right.Are you still taking the, uh, Campral?Um-hum.Yeah, the Campral, too. Um, and you have no heart difficulties?No.Nothing like that and, uh, I'm wondering if we should, uh, try like a low dose of a stimulant to see, uh, why you, why, maybe if you keep craving caffeine, it's for like an organizing affect. Did you do it as a kid, too, drink a lot of pop and Mountain Dew [INAUDIBLE] -No, not until, you know, my 20s that I start drinking a lot of caffeine.I'm inclined because of the severity what you had before, you know, recently, that we just hold off, but I, in the back of my mind now I'm wondering if there is an attentional deficit problem in the background that might be stimulating your caffeine use and I'm wondering if that might have a calming effect on you. You're not tired during the day, right? Does this, does this stimulated affect last through the day or how long does it last for?Just the morning.Like an hour, 2 hours, just after you take it.Yeah.Um. Well, maybe, maybe we should just hold off and, and see over time if this goes away and experiment with the caffeine. See if you cut back, it gets better -Um-hum.If you take more is it better?Yeah.If, if my theory that it is an ADD component actually more caffeine, I mean, will that make you more calm.Right.It would be the opposite effect so maybe different days have more, different amounts and see what you feel and then I'll figure out what we do, you know, with any ADD component down the road. Because people who tend to use drugs and alcohol also many times have an attentional problem. If you look at the research, people with ADD have like a 3 to 4 times increase in substance abuse.Well, about attentional problem, um, what exactly, can you give me an example?Well, distractibility, impulsivity goes along with that -I'm impulsive, but -You are.I don't really get distracted.No.Once I start something, you know, I see it through.If you have an adre, if you, if you start something that you really like, you get an adrenaline rush -Right.And that will help stimulate you.Yeah.But like it's hard, say if you're in a boring class or you're, you know, your, you, then your mind wonders everywhere. Is that -Um -What you noticed when -When I first get off the alcohol, my mind races.Right, I see -You know, I'm thinking this way, that way, this way, that way -Yeah, you see, we have the alcohol affecting your brain, too -Right.So it's hard, as I said originally, you know, you're depressed, but the alcohol affects your brain the more time you have away from alcohol the more your brain stabilizes -Right.So, why don't we, why don't we not, I mean, this isn't, it's only for a short time when you have this and it's not a negative or terribly overwhelming negative feeling -Right you're just -And so, and you're so much better if you, if we score it from 0 to 10 with the Prozac, 0 being no change, 10, 100% improvement, how would you rate it?Um, as far as how I feel overall or -Yeah.From 1 to 10 improvement?Um-hum.I'd say a 7, it's just those 2 little things, you know, it's the sweating and the -The sweating actually I could give you something for sweating if you want, I mean, there's, uh, certain -I sweat like a pig anyway, this makes it even worse.Yeah, there -I mean, it drips down me.Drips down you. Now there are a couple of medicines that I've sometimes used, um, that sometimes can reduce sweating. If you want, I can give you one to try, I mean is it worse during certain times of the day or -When I'm working, you know.When you're working, is it worse -Up and down stairs, up and down ladders, you know [INAUDIBLE] -What about in the warmer weather, is it worse?Yeah, that, that's when I have a problem.Yeah.You know, that's why I like winter [LAUGHING].Yeah, the Prozac definitely would make the sweating worse. So that's the main side effect -That's the one I don't like, I mean, um, I'm dealing with this stuff, but, you know the sweating is -Let me give you something, you know, their pretty benign and you're healthy physically so you might want to try something to see if it just reduces it a little bit at the worse times and, but, I mean, overall 77% increase is good. I, I think you're going to get better, I think you'll go up to 80, 90% increase, I really believe the more time away from the alcohol, the more time on the Prozac, I mean your mood is much brighter, right -Um-hum.You don't have any angst about going to work -Right.Work is smooth and, has it picked up or is it -You know how, it's still slow, which -It's still slow -I don't like, but -Do you like -Too much time on my hands then, you know -Do you like being busy?Yeah.If you're not at the job, what do you do, how do you spend the time, is it -Well, you know, pay bills, work around the house, um -Exercise at all?Yeah, yeah, I've been doing that probably 3 times a week, sometimes 4.But if you have a lot of free time during the day, maybe go for a walk or something -Depends on weather. You know, I'll take the dog out and -Take the dog -Mess around with him, but -No, that's good.Um, I think I'm, yeah, I'm consciously trying to stay a little busy -Yeah.Because, you know, that's, that's something that I've had trouble with in the past.What do you mean?Too much time on my hands and, and then, you know -Then you started thinking -And then the weather starts up -Right, but no desire to go back to the liquor store?Uh, yeah, I still have that.You still have that. So every day is a struggle for you?If I'm not busy, yeah.Um, are you going to meetings or no?Um-hum.Is that helping?Um, no.Not really.No.You don't like the meetings or you -No, I'm just, it's the same ole, same ole to me. I hear the same things, you know, I, I've been going for off and on for 5 years, but this last year a lot, you know, at least 2, 3 times a week.Do you do the talking, or mostly listening?I talk, yeah.What do you talk about?Well, whatever the subject is.You follow the 12 steps -Yeah, right.Do you have friends in the meeting?Um-hum.So it's like a social time, too, isn't it, I mean -Yeah.You're not real heh, heh.Well, it is but, you know, it's always at night and, um, always puts a damper on it, I guess, you know, I, it's, as long as I'm in the routine, it's fine. If I get out of that routine, too, then it's like, you know -Um-hum.A pain to go.Yeah, that's the same thing about exercise.Right, exactly.It's a pain to go there. Once you break it, it's hard to start on something.Um-hum.The old law of physics. The law of physics, an object -Yeah, I've always been a guy who needs a routine, so I don't know if that's any insight either, but I always need a routine, I have to do things a certain way -Well, how routine is it, would you say it's almost obsessive? Like you have to do the same thing when you get up every morning and -I, I wouldn't call it obsessive, but I like to be in that routine, I like to do the same things, uh, in a time frame, you know, I like, I never like to be late, any of that stuff, you know, I like things organized and -Scrutinized?Yeah.Yeah. When you're on the alcohol, does that lessen that -Oh, yeah.So when you're off it, it becomes more -Right.Yeah, but it doesn't bother you, it's not like you feel angst about it.No. No, it would put me in a bad mood.Like if you're driving, if you're driving a certain direction and you feel it's not the same direction you drove, you don't have to drive around to go back the same -No, no.Okay. Well, probably just part of your personality structure -Um-hum.Exercise would help that, too, because the more you exercise, the more at peace you feel.Right.The more at peace, the less you worry about things like that. Have you noticed improvement, in relationships?Um-hum.Like you're happier and the dating situation is better, too, less stress and she noticed this change, too?Um-hum.Good. Yeah, I think it's definitely the right combination right now and I, I guess now it's a matter of keeping you out of the depression but also preventing the relapse. You know, relapse is something we got to look at down the road and, as they say in meetings, it is a one day at a time, I mean, everyday that you abstain is a success basically.Right, but the reason I came here to begin with is because I, I did put in time, you know, a lot of time, you now 5 months, 9 months, a year and then relapse.Yeah.Um -So the question is what happens that triggers the relapse?Right.What do you think?I don't know.Well the component that we are adding now is that we are treating the depression -Right.Which wasn't before -Right.So I'm wondering if, I mean, my personal belief is that alcohol and depression go hand in hand, depression might be the original disorder and then people start drinking almost as a self medication and then they develop a secondary disease and the secondary disease is alcoholism.Um-hum.And I think, I remember there were some studies, I think they were done out of, um, oh, what's the, Iowa, the University of Iowa where they were looking at women and men who have alcohol problems and the research indicated that there were twice as many men with alcohol problems than women, but if you factored in depressive disorder, it was equal, 50/50. So, men sometimes tend, because of the social acceptability, you know, to get into a drinking pattern more than, than women, but, hell, lately I see a lot of women, I got to guess at the meetings, there are a lot of women drinkers, but, uh, my hope is that -Yes, it's twice, it's twice as many at the, at the meetings.Men than women still?Yeah.It is?Sure.But my hope is that if, if we control the underlying depression with the Prozac, the chance of relapse will reduce, that's my hope. Do we do anything else to prevent it? Uh, what else can we do, I mean we could use the Campral, which is a chemical, you know, which can help, so I thought, I'd like to be on the combination, but like you say, in the past, after 5 months, 9 months, you don't know what it is that triggered it or -Well, I've talked about it a lot, a lot of it probably is, you know, complacency, you know, I'm I, I get away from what keeps me sober, you know, God and, and uh, and maybe not making the meetings and that type of thing. I get complacent.So the support system you kind of -Yeah, I kind of, I back away from it after a while. Like I just did this last time, too. You know, it's, I'm just -Do you see it coming or it's like a gradual withdrawal?Actually, no, I don't see it coming until it happens. And then once I'm done with that binge, then I look back on it and go, well, see you didn't do this, you didn't do that -I see -You know -So you don't see the prodrome of it, but -Yeah.But is the relapse abrupt or is the relapse slow -It's slow.Pardon?It's slower, it depends, this last time was really fast. You know I went from beer one day to vodka the very next, but normally before then, it would be slow.Describe the, the pattern.Um, I would have a beer -One beer.Yeah, and that would be it for that week. And then, you know, maybe the next week, have a few more and then go day to day beer and then probably a month later, I'm on the hard stuff where this time it was like one day beer, the next day vodka right away.Okay. Well, maybe the key for you, then, is to look at any drink as, as a relapse.Um-hum.One drink becomes a relapse. Could, could you look at it in that -Oh, yeah, I do look at it that way.All right, so that, that -There's just, there's just a, a, period of good time that I'm just not looking at myself internally and not being honest with myself and, you know, I, I, I deny what's going on.And denial -You know, I lie to myself basically [LAUGHING].So you would have a drink and not even acknowledge that you're doing it in other words.Um, yes, it's just like, big deal, one drink.Yeah. How could, how could we keep that at the focus or the center so it's always on your mind, I mean is there -And that's tiresome, too.Yeah. How many meetings a week do you go to now?Right now, just one.One meeting. Okay. Well, I guess we're going to have to see, you know, if the Prozac makes a difference, if the Campral going to make a difference over time, but I still think there needs to be, like you say, the one drink indicator, so, I mean, if you have one drink, you got to call me, you got to, you know, you had the sponsor you got to call, I mean, we, we've got to jump at that first beer -Um-hum.Type of thing. You know, maybe not think about it every day, but in the back of your mind, realize that that any one drink is the, is the key. And then we'll kind of try to take a look at, at how to prevent, you know, the second day or the extra beers -I know. And like you say being the -Being busy and distractibility -Yeah.Exercise, the meetings, I mean, you like being routinized so the more you stay in this routine, and it's working, you know, the better you'll be. And my hope is that jitteriness is going to go away just with the Prozac. If it doesn't, like I say, we, we could look into, you know, this other attentional component and maybe consider another medicine management combination, but I'd rather wait, because like I say, alcohol changes the brain in, in ways that, it's all neurotransmitter based, we talked about that. You know, when the neurotransmitters approaching pieces that are unbalanced in the brain, we feel better. When the probing pieces are out of balance in the brain, we feel worse and alcohol triggers changes on like an hourly basis after you drink, you know, 2 hours, we talked about glutamate going up and then after 2 hours, the glutamate starts coming down and the gabba goes up and the gabba is actually a depressing neurotransmitter, it's an inhibitor neurotransmitter so, so really it's, it's a dangerous, dangerous drug, and, and people don't, don't see it because they get so caught up, you know, in the enjoyment of it or is it enjoyment, I don't know, I mean, what, what do you get when you drink, I mean, what does it do for you? What did it to for you in the past?It, uh, I'd say like in my 20s, it just put me in a great mood.And like, they talk about bottled courage, that it gave you like more confidence, or did it?Um, it didn't, in certain ways it made me more assertive.Oh, it did.Yeah, in certain ways it did.Um.My personal issues, it probably made me more assertive and in work issues, it probably made me less assertive [LAUGHING]. You know, because, uh -Didn't care, more complacent.Right. Which in work sometimes better in, you now, when you're a boss and -You mean if you're managing other people?Right.That's not your case.Well, it was back in my third, I had people working for me.Oh, in your own, in your own business.Yeah. Now I don't.Is it better this way or -Oh, yeah, it's much better this way.Is it?Yeah, I like it much better.Because you didn't like managing the people?Right.Mm.Little bit of a control freak type guy so -Mm, so people may mistake you for responsible.Yeah, I would, yeah I'd go over that.So now it's all on your shoulder, though, physical, I mean, if there's, if there's a lot of lifting and things like that.Um, no, I have, I have my son help me when I need it. He's [AGE], so -Is he going to go into business with you?I don't think so, maybe, who knows.Do you want him to?I don't really care, you know, whatever he wants to do.I mean, just wonder if it will help you out, though, as time goes on, as you get older, too.Um-hum. Well the thing is, do I have enough work for him? [LAUGHING], you know, I just can't have him hanging around me all day not doing anything, so -Well he's still in school, right?Yeah.Like for the summer, he'll work with you?Um, probably.Do things pick up in the summer or you can't tell.No, um, the way things are going now, I don't know. I mean, I basically had, I have a couple remodel jobs going, which keep me going, um, but, you know, I like doing service calls and I've only, I've only had like 4 last week, service calls so the phone isn't ringing very much.Is that because things aren't breaking or because people just don't want to spend the money if it breaks or -Well, people aren't, you know, people aren't spending money.What were the calls, I mean, what do you do on your calls?Um, like, uh, um, outside faucets, replacing outside faucets, just stuff that has to be done -Like freezing -Yeah, that froze over the winter and then you, they turn on faucet and it would leak all over inside people's basements.Really?Yeah, because they're, they're that long and the shut off in the inside of the house, so when they open it up, it leaks right, right there inside the house.Um.So I, I get a few, I get a lot of those in the spring. People first turn on their faucets, they've left the hose on them all winter, so it stays in that pipe, you're supposed to take off your hose on outside faucets -Right.And, uh, so that water isn't trapped in there and drains out through the winter so there's nothing to freeze. But when it's stuck in there, and frozen, then it expands and busts the pipe.Right, right. Um, so this is the season for that?Yeah. And sump pumps and you know water heaters, that's pretty much what it is, it's you know, people aren't remodeling their basements like they used to and -You did remodeling -Yeah, I used to do a lot of those.Yeah, um-hum.Bathroom, remodeling bathrooms, you know, there's not much call for that lately.Yeah, you know, the economy is still tight, so, would it help to advertise that business.Oh, I do.Oh, you do.Yeah.Do you get some calls for that or -Not lately. I think, I think most of my stuff comes over the internet and the yellow pages. You know, they'll Google, um, and, uh, in the yellow pages, I'm in the 2 different sets the Dex and the, uh, oh, the Yellow, Yellow Book I think it's called. Yellow Book takes over a wider area than Dex, Dex is just [DEIDENTIFIED].That's your primary ground, though, right.Um-hum.I don't know, I mean I see this in the, I tell you I have another fellow I know, a plumber out west of here, he was telling me, you know, it's been so slow, I mean, he's doing it all himself, you know, he used to have people work for him and he had to let everybody go.Um-hum.So, it's not just you, it's just the nature -Yeah, if you go down to the Union Hall, there are like 200 plumbers sitting there.Are you a union plumber, or -Uh, yeah.Oh, yeah, okay.You know, I don't really contribute since I'm by myself, but if I hire somebody, it'll be Union, yeah.So you couldn't actually get a job through the Union Hall [INAUDIBLE] -I did at one time, I went and worked for [DEIDENTIFIED] for about 6 months -Oh, you did [LAUGHING].Yeah, but it was, uh, kind of, uh, um, I had torn something up in my knee, my meniscus, I tore it up and I basically went to work for them just to get the insurance for 3 or 4 months.How'd you like working for him?I didn't like it much.No. I know.No, there, uh, you know, their knowledgeable and stuff, but, um -Boy they charge a lot [LAUGHING].Don't tell me when I was -Astronomical.With the [DEIDENTIFIED], I'm sure it's higher now.Astronomical, I mean, yeah.And, uh, they put GPS's on your vans and, and, uh -To monitor where you go?Yeah -Oh -And, and, uh, every minute of your day has to be accounted for. I mean, you're not really allowed to go clean out your truck, you have to charge that to somebody.Really.Yeah, so if you get like, if you're lucky, because they charge minimum charge, by, I'd say by the hour. So if I'm there 15 minutes, you know, then I have time to, to, uh, you now maybe head back to the shop if it's in the vicinity and, and you know, clean out things, but you can't, you can't charge their company any time for loading or unloading and, uh, I, you know, I thought that was a little, little over the line.Um-hum.I mean there should be a half hour every day for that.Um.In my opinion.Yeah, it's amazing though because he's got -And it ends up, they've got, you know, 15, 20 trucks that are a giant mess inside, you know, they have all this advertising about how clean their trucks are, well that's just the outside, I'll tell you that right now because if you look in one of them trucks -Their dirty inside.Oh, my God.How did he get so popular, though, I mean, I don't know how he built up such a big business, I don't know how.Well, he hires decent guys, I mean -To do all the work.Yeah, he knows who to hire and who to fire.I knew someone, I can tell, I knew somebody who he bid a job for that this guy had a, I don't think you've heard, but he, what happened was he had a blockage, um, I don't know if it was the sink going out blocked or something so he couldn't use it and [DEIDENTIFIED] quoted him $11,000 for to, to repair and then he got somebody else to do it for $3,000, I mean, that's a huge difference in terms of -Um-hum.The amount of work, so -Yeah, he has, he has all his guys go out and give estimates, too.Did you do that, too?Yeah. I mean to me that's a managerial job.Yeah.Um -Did it help you in your own business or did it -Yeah, it did actually, yeah.You were able to charge more, probably [LAUGHING].Well, yeah, they do these coupons, you know, they send out these coupons all the time for, you know 10% off, well they're already charging, you know, [LAUGHING], an arm and a leg anyway, so 10% isn't going to, so, you know, so I do that.Yeah.So -Well, all right, just hang in there.But they do, they do, a lot of stuff is, they're really pretty organized as far as like if, you know, they won't tell you on the phone how much anything's going to cost, they want to get their foot in the door to give you an estimate and then, say it's a water heater leaking, you know, you just can't call up [DEIDENTIFIED] and go, I have a water heater leaking how much to, uh, uh, you know, change it out. They won't tell you on the phone, we'll send a guy out and give you a free estimate and then once they're in the door, you know, they can go, well, you know, it's going to cost this much, but I can do it right now because they'll have a guy come in a truck and bring you a water heater.Right. I got upset with him about 20 years ago -[LAUGHING].No, I'm serious, he did something like that. I had furnaces and he came in and he looked at my furnaces, I don't remember it was [NAME OTHER], it was when they were starting or something, I think it was [NAME OTHER], he's still there -Um-hum.And he, he came in and he, it might not have been him, I don't remember, but anyway, maybe it was a worker, and they looked and they said I had cracks in my furnaces and that I had to replace the furnaces.Um-hum.I, I got another opinion and he said, no, that's normal, the, I, just replaced them, last, 20 years later, I just replaced the furnace, so they lasted for 20 years -Um-hum.And he wanted me to replace them right then, you know, because he said the cracks wouldn't, wouldn't make them work or something.Well, in the heat, cracks in the heat exchanger?Oh, I don't even remember what it was.Because that is dangerous because then, you know, you get carbon monoxide coming out of it.Is it, really. Yeah, but it was 20 years, and they lasted all those years, so, I got a little annoyed with him and -Well, some people swear by them, you know -I know, I know -They have a lot of return customers.Well, I know. Yeah. Yeah, they started, it must be what 25, how long have you been in the business?I've been 21 years.I thought -I've been in business 21 years, but I've been in plumbing since I was [AGE], I'm [AGE] now, so -Thirty years yeah. I think they started about 25 years -I don't know. It was like 2 years ago I did that.Two years. Just for 6 months.Really, I don't, I think it was 4 months actually.Then you left -Three months I was insured -But then you just left, you didn't want to be with them anymore?Right.Yeah.Yeah, I got -Did they give you -My left, got my knee fixed and then went back into business [LAUGHING].Did they give you a hard time when you left?Uh, no, no, um, they were kind of slow at that time anyway, so he had me in the office, you know, getting prints and stuff, which was extremely boring -Um-hum.Um, you know, I don't like being in an office, I like being out, you know, I -Yeah.I couldn't even stand being in school -Yeah, with your nature, I think you do better in your own business, I don't see you working for somebody, you don't like to be controlled -Right.You're like me [LAUGHING]. All right, but I think we're in the right direction.Okay.So like I say, we'll just keep what we're doing -Yeah, that's the only 2 complaints I got.Yeah. If it doesn't go away, do you feel comfortable going a month from now and, and -Yeah.Touching base in a month.Um-hum.And, uh, it should be better by then, if not, then we can address this other issue.Yeah, I just figured because it's 40, you know, I just figured it -Forty is a big dose, um, do we cut you back, I mean, the reason we went to the higher dose is because you felt that you needed more medicine usually so, do you want to alternate 40/20, 40/20 and see -Maybe I should.If you want to do that, I don't want to lose the benefit we're getting -Right.But you can try that and see if reducing it, I could give you 30, the problem with 30, there's no 30 mg pill -Right.So you'd have to take, do you have capsules or tablets?Capsules.Well you could open, open them up or I can give you another prescription for 20s if you want and -But you'd have to take them every day, I couldn't go 40 every other day?Yeah, Prozac actually is a long acting drug so -So why don't I just try going every other day then with 40.All right, we could try the 40 -Because then I'll see, if the next day, and I don't take it -You're, if that goes away.Yeah.Yeah, we can try that. But promise me you'll call me if, if there's any relapse or risk of relapse.Okay, all right.Because that's something, I mean -Not right now, but certainly -No, I'm serious, because like I said, that's a key for you, you know, the first beer you're drinking -Um-hum.You can call and then we'll reassess the medicine. But, yeah, Prozac is the kind of drug that you don't, you won't get withdrawal if you miss a day. So what you'll do is you'll just lower the level to, yeah, we can, we can try that. But if you start feeling worse, you know, go back up to the 40.Absolutely, yeah.So you don't need any refills or anything now?No.All right, sounds good."][[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]dataY[0]: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
